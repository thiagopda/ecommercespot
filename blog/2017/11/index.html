				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>When it comes to finding niche products to sell online, randomness kills all.</p>
<p>Far too often we get stuck in the mindset that all you have to do is spend time brainstorming to randomly land on a few good ideas.</p>
<p><strong>But here&#8217;s what:</strong></p>
<p>This approach may occasionally land you on a respectable product that sells well through an online store, but more often than not you end up with a product that&#8217;s either too far ahead of its time (so it doesn&#8217;t have a market yet) or a product that&#8217;s in an overly-saturated market.</p>
<p>Neither of these situations work out for you since the potential for making money relies on consumers getting used to a product or you spending countless hours and dollars trying to break into an impenetrable market.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you should focus on a more methodical approach to finding niche ideas for online business.</p>
<p><span id="more-13317"></span></p>
<p>This way, you&#8217;re not randomly selecting and choosing products. Also, the next time you search for niche products you&#8217;ll have a process to lean on.</p>
<h2>The Golden Rule: Stop Thinking About Your Experiences and Go Straight to the Data</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s human nature to sit down and brainstorm like this:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;What problems have I had in my life that haven&#8217;t been solved by a product?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Which products do I see all my friends and family buying? They must be popular!&#8221; </em></p>
<p>These thoughts deliver faulty results. Your personal life problems don&#8217;t necessarily reflect those of others. Also, &#8220;my friends and family,&#8221; is not even close to a good enough sample size.</p>
<p>Creative people are given the advice to write, draw, paint, film, or design whatever makes them excited, but that thinking isn&#8217;t going to sell you more products online.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why your personal biases and experiences should be removed from the equation as frequently as possible.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you have access to hard data from places like eBay, Amazon, Google, and other shopping engines. This data delivers nothing but the truth, with details on how actual products sell to actual customers.</p>
<p>Therefore, for your own sanity and business success, cut past the brainstorming process that uses your own life experiences. The best route is with data.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Once you skip speculation and go straight to the data, it&#8217;s important to focus on one particular niche with your online store. This way, Google considers the store to be a topical authority, and you have more interlinking opportunities with your own blogs and other blogs.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Tap into Amazon Sales Data to Find the Best Selling Online Products</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re shopping on Amazon you might not immediately realize that sales data is published all over the website.</p>
<p>Seeing as how Amazon is the top eCommerce website in the United States (and many other countries,) it makes sense to use it as a testing ground.</p>
<p>The good news is that every single product on Amazon is assigned a best sellers ranking. So, if a niche product is listed in the Action Figures category, Amazon ranks its sales in that particular category.</p>
<p>Since most niche products are listed under multiple categories, you might see numerous rankings across these categories.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13408" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-find-the-best-niche-products-to-sell-on-your-store.png" alt="" width="650" height="48" /></p>
<p>For instance, I looked up a product called Fisher-Price Disney Mickey &amp; the Roadster Racers, Roadster Racers Garage Playset.</p>
<p>The most revealing metric is that of the primary category. In this situation, it&#8217;s the Toys and Games category. This niche product is ranked as #711 at the time.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll also notice that it jumps to #19 for the subcategory Action Figures and #352 for Pre-Kindergarten Toys.</p>
<p>This rankings system provides a scale for comparing popular products with other items on Amazon. Since Amazon has a huge customer base and tons of sales each day, the sample size is more than big enough for you to trust the results. In addition, you don&#8217;t have to pay any money or go digging too deep to locate these rankings.</p>
<p><strong>My Conclusion for This Niche Product:</strong> Choosing a toys and games niche for your online store is far too broad, but the Action Figures category looks promising. if you already have an action figures website, it&#8217;s not a bad idea to stick with niche products under #100.</p>
<p>As for using the Amazon rankings system as your main product search tool, you might find it somewhat tedious to click through so many products. In fact, there&#8217;s nothing that compares or organizes your results unless you plan on pulling information and inserting it into Excel.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I recommend searching Amazon using a tool like Jungle Scout.</p>
<p>Along with several other features, Jungle Scout has a Niche Hunter option:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13409" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-find-the-best-niche-products-to-sell-on-your-store-1.png" alt="" width="650" height="371" /></p>
<p>With the Niche Hunter, you&#8217;ll have access to far more information than just a bunch of rankings.</p>
<p>For instance, I could filter categories and search for niche products in those categories with average units sold between 500 and 1000 over a certain amount of time. This delivers the most promising results, and you can also search for things like quality score, competition, and average price.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Find Niche Products with Google</h2>
<p>Google is becoming more and more popular for shopping, and most of this has to do with the increasing focus Google puts on Google Shopping results.</p>
<p>Some people would rather go straight to Amazon, or whatever other stores they shop at, but Google has the advantage of aggregating results from different sites and showing multiple price comparisons.</p>
<p>As you may have already assumed, Google Shopping has enough users to make the data worthwhile.</p>
<p>Another reason we like researching products through Google is that it reveals how difficult it will be to end up high in the search results.</p>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Your best bet for finding the best selling online products through Google is to utilize the Google Keyword Planner.</p>
<p>The trick with this tool is to type in and analyze some of the exact keywords that customers might be typing in themselves. This is an excellent process to follow after you&#8217;ve decided on a few potential niches from the previous Amazon search.</p>
<p>The only problem with going through the Google Keyword Planner is that it&#8217;s tough to understand the results.</p>
<p>First of all, it&#8217;s important to only look at the keywords that focus on products.</p>
<p>For example, the keyword &#8220;female travel tips&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make sense for finding niche products, since the people searching are most likely looking for information, such as a blog posts.</p>
<p>A better keyword would be something like &#8220;anti-theft travel purse,&#8221; since this is going to lead people to a product or category page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13411" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-find-the-best-niche-products-to-sell-on-your-store-2.png" alt="" width="650" height="484" /></p>
<p>Leave the default settings and click on the Get Ideas button. This reveals an onslaught of information that can be both confusing and eye-opening. For instance, we can see that millions of searches are being completed for the anti-theft purse, and some more specific keywords receive some impressive numbers as well. The competition is high, however, so this means that lots of advertisers are bidding on these keywords.</p>
<p>This leaves us in a sticky situation since we know that the keyword is popular, but it might be so popular that we can&#8217;t get any search engine exposure.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13410" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-find-the-best-niche-products-to-sell-on-your-store-3.png" alt="" width="650" height="409" /></p>
<p>This dilemma brings us back to the importance of niche products. Not only do you want to focus on highly-niche markets, but niche keywords as well. One of the best ways to do this is by only targeting long tail keywords, or less popular, yet still effective keywords.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by using a tool like Long Tail Pro, which delivers a more useful version of the &#8220;competition&#8221; portion of Google Keyword Planner.</p>
<p>In short, Long Tail Pro ranks keywords based on &#8220;keyword competitiveness,&#8221; instead of how many marketers are competing for a particular keyword.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13412" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/how-to-find-the-best-niche-products-to-sell-on-your-store-4.png" alt="" width="650" height="247" /></p>
<p>This way, you can see how well you&#8217;re going to be able to target customers with a certain keyword.</p>
<p>For instance, the anti-theft travel purse might not be all that strong for your business, but something like a slash proof backpack may be a keyword that&#8217;ll show some results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 3: Use Niche Product Rules to Eliminate Bad Choices</h2>
<p>Although I recommend using both of the methods outlined above, we also have some rules you should always follow throughout the process.</p>
<p>These product guidelines come in handy to eliminate some products or even full categories of niche products.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell niche products that list at more than $15.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t go much higher than $200.</li>
<li>Stay away from seasonal products that only bring in money during a certain time of the year.</li>
<li>Only sell items that don&#8217;t lose value as they sit on shelves. For example, electronics lose value fast.</li>
<li>Sell products with more ambiguous pricing. Everyone knows what an electronic item should sell for, but informational items and jewelry are more subjective in pricing.</li>
<li>Choose items that are easy to ship and not breakable.</li>
<li>Smaller products work best for niche stores.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Are You Ready to Find Niche Products for Your Online Store?</h2>
<p>Locating the perfect niche product involves using data and the right analysis tools. Forget about solving life problems and brainstorming from your own experiences. These methods typically make you frustrated and deliver bad results.</p>

<p class="p1">The holiday season in major cities around the world is typically heralded by seasonal window retail displays put up by department stores and retailers large and small.</p>
<p class="p1">We can trace their beginnings back to the industrial revolution.</p>
<p class="p1">The widespread availability of plate glass in the late 1800s allowed shop owners to build large windows spanning the full lengths of their shops for the display of merchandise.</p>
<p class="p1">This is when the notion of window-shopping was born.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17602" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/the-genesis-of-holiday-window-displays-2.jpg" alt="holiday retail display" width="583" height="400" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/holiday-window-display-hero.jpg 583w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/holiday-window-display-hero-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></p>

<p class="p1">One of the first major holiday window displays was put up by Macy’s New York store in 1874. It featured a collection of porcelain dolls and scenes from Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”</p>
<p class="p1">It was not until the early 1900s that competition for grabbing the attention of customers intensified among the largest retailers in three major cities in the United States –– New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. Store owners and managers used window displays to lure window shoppers into their stores; and over the holidays the display were a lot more colorful and creative.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">By 1914 Saks was stirring public intrigue at their flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York with the emergence of ‘unveiling events’ for their display window.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Hydraulic lifts beneath the windows allowed teams of artisans to work on new designs out of public view.</p>
<p class="p1">But it was Lord &amp; Taylor that really pioneered this effort when, in 1938, the owners eschewed the traditional method of presenting store merchandise in favor of a purely decorative display of gilded bells that swung in sync with the sounds of recorded bells.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17601" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/the-genesis-of-holiday-window-displays-3.jpg" alt="holiday window display" width="350" height="467" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/holiday-window-display.jpg 350w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/holiday-window-display-300x400.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>

<p class="p1">This represents the full transition from windows being used to display products to those intended solely as a marvel to draw people to the store and generate interest and discussion. It was a physical version of what John Lewis and others would later do, using advertisements as an anticipated event in themselves without including products.</p>
<p class="p1">Competition for shopper attention has continuously intensified, and retailers have correspondingly adapted. Window displays appeal to consumers on a number of more unique levels in comparison to TV or online advertisements.</p>
<p class="p1">Being physical, a grand display is much more of a marvel than something viewed through another medium. Further, by requiring customers to visit the store to view the window, these displays actively engage the audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Over the decades department stores have teamed up with designers, artists and other companies such as for Bergdorf’s 2015 display created with Swarovski. With the capacity for grandiosity and innovation driven by competition, grand window displays can be repeated annually without losing their impact.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Holiday Marketing Takeaway</h2>
<p class="p1">Create something spectacular that your customers have to enjoy by coming to your store in person.</p>

<p class="p1">Campbell’s 1948 magazine campaign clearly has one audience in mind: wives and mothers, or female homemakers.</p>
<p class="p1">The advertisement shows a typical holiday scene, with mother and children carrying bundles of wrapped presents while father is almost unnoticeable in the background.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In 1948, it was the woman of a household who would invariably do much of the cooking, childcare and indeed Christmas shopping.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This advertisement draws on the pressures and time-constraints placed on the mother (and all such women) as she prepares for the holiday season. It offers her a solution to find more time during the Christmas-rushed days.</p>
<p class="p1">Although the advertisement provides pictures and descriptions of several available soups, it focuses on value over product placement. The primary aim is to show women how Campbell’s Soup can save them time, offering a product which is not only tasty but, more importantly, fast and easy to prepare.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Holiday Marketing Takeaway</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Don’t just show your customers your product</strong>; <strong>tell them how it will benefit their lives over the holidays.</strong></p>

<p class="p1">When Norelco started using animated advertisements to market their electric razors along with other personal grooming products within the 1960s, animation like a media form was neither particularly advanced, nor made an appearance regularly on tv.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In to the 1970s, however, Norelco’s Christmas spots grew to become among the indications that christmas had truly showed up.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Famously featuring Father Christmas sledding with an upturned razor attachment, Norelco not just created an advert which may be acquainted for many years in the future, but pioneered among the earliest purposes of animation to promote to adults.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/718DpmQrPbg" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></center></p>
<p class="p1">They accomplished it partially by using probably the most advanced animation at that time.</p>
<p class="p1">Actually, the ads were so effective that, once they aired during animated Rankin/Bass programs, viewers were frequently unsure in regards to what would be a created area of the show and just what was just advertising.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17622 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/norelco-popularizes-stop-motion-animation-2.jpg" alt="norelco holiday campaign shaving advertisement" width="500" height="644" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Norelco-Shaving-Ad-1967.jpg 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Norelco-Shaving-Ad-1967-300x386.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><em>Photo Source</em></p>
<p class="p1">Once established, later versions from the ad focused less on Santa’s journey and spent additional time displaying products to customers. At that time, obviously, the format from the advertisement was instantly recognizable and connected using the Norelco brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Over the last years, the ad continues to be designed to incorporate newer animation technologies for example CGI, retaining its familiar structure and dedication to quality animation.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Holiday Marketing Takeaway</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Be the first one to create quality content using technology and new media.</strong> Today, augmented reality. Tomorrow…?</p>

<p class="p1">The biggest challenge with advertising drink and food is actually conveying its essential features for an audience –– taste.</p>
<p class="p1">Earlier ads from Folgers required devote exclusive restaurants in which the coffee was secretly switched with Folgers’ product.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">However, within their 1986 commercial, the narrative of the relative coming back for Christmas is eminently more relatable for many consumers than likely to an costly restaurant.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">The ad’s recognizable figures also respond in familiar methods to the coffee product. The kids smell the coffee because they allow it to be, so that as each member of the family wakes they take deep inhalations from the aroma wafting with the house.</p>
<p class="p1">Everyone notices the merchandise, even when they can&#8217;t view it. The round of satisfied sighs as everyone enjoys that coffee further reinforces the taste that the audience aren&#8217;t able to take part in.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4kNl7cQdcU" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></center></p>
<p class="p1">The campaign isn&#8217;t just good at conveying the essential features and value of the merchandise. It&#8217;s also selling an idealistic Christmas scene, connecting quaint and happy family existence using the product within the audience’s mind. The commercial ran until 1998 as well as in edited form until 2005, transforming Folgers in to the U.S.’s leading coffee brand.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Folgers was subsequently offered for $3 billion in 2008, as well as in 2009 the most popular ad was somewhat less effectively reimagined.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Indeed, the follow up is responsible for debate, with viewers suggesting the brother-sister relationship is under innocent. The point is, the campaign’s success is shown by both its durability and Forgers’ resulting market dominance.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Holiday Marketing Takeaway</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Turn your brand right into a household name by it into a relatable story.</strong></p>
