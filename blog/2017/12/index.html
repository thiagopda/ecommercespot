				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cheap or free open source ecommerce platform, you&#8217;ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Well, technically, you could choose just about any ecommerce framework, since the majority of them are rather inexpensive as it is.</p>
<p>However, the open source model has brought about all sorts of praise from the people who use it, especially considering these online store systems are completely free, they&#8217;re managed and developed by numerous people around the world, and you can typically find lots of documentation and blog posts to guide you along your way.</p>
<p>When researching and choosing any of these ecommerce frameworks, it&#8217;s important to decide the type of development experience you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions you should consider asking yourself:<span id="more-13517"></span></p>
<p>Are you interested in self-hosting?</p>
<p>Or would you rather pay a small fee per month to have hosting and all ecommerce features wrapped up in one nice package?</p>
<p>One of the main decisions is whether you&#8217;d like one of the open source (free) ecommerce platforms or a more user-friendly one that involves a monthly fee.</p>
<p>For instance, you could opt to pay as little as $9 per month for an ecommerce platform like Shopify, which has everything like hosting, a website builder, plugins, marketing tools, and inventory options included.</p>
<p>I personally would always go with an option like Shopify over an open source system, but there are some reasons to consider the latter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source ecommerce frameworks are free.</li>
<li>You often have more creative control over the design and how the store works.</li>
<li>Open source solutions are often packed with more unique features because they are constantly being developed.</li>
<li>You can control things like hosting, plugins and themes that would go into your store.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, there are several downsides to open source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source ecommerce platforms typically require more development or coding knowledge (but you can always hire a developer).</li>
<li>You have to look around to find a server for hosting by yourself.</li>
<li>All the site related operations such as maintenance, security, and speed optimization have to be done by you.</li>
<li>The website designers are usually less user-friendly compared to ones in major ecommerce frameworks like Shopify.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t get dedicated support. So, if you&#8217;re someone who needs to call or email a support rep, open source might not be for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely up to you to decide which type of platform is right for you, but for now, let&#8217;s talk about the best open source ecommerce platforms on the market.</p>
<h2>1. WooCommerce (On WordPress)</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13527 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017.jpg" alt="an open source ecommerce platform" width="650" height="407" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WooCommerce_001-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin, so you&#8217;ll have to install WordPress (open source) on your host, then install the WooCommerce plugin onto your site. It automatically turns any WordPress website into a fully functional online store, with inventory management, coupons, and product pages.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The plugin is free to download and install. Many stores don&#8217;t need anything more than the plugin.</li>
<li>It connects to all major payment gateways.</li>
<li>With a WooCommerce theme, you hardly have to do any work besides adding content.</li>
<li>You can offer coupons and discounts, along with adding multiple other features with the help of the extension library.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of extra expenses such as a WooCommerce theme, extra extensions, hosting, and domain name.</li>
<li>WooCommerce has several moving parts. On the surface, it requires hosting + WordPress + the WooCommerce plugin. Beginners can get intimidated by this, especially with tasks like SEO, security, hosting, and caching.</li>
<li>WooCommerce technically works with all WordPress themes, but it&#8217;s kind of a joke unless you get one made just for WooCommerce.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. X-Cart</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13529" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="526" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-1.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/X-Cart-300x243.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>X-Cart has helped to create over 35,000 online stores, and this has been growing over the past years. As with all of these ecommerce platforms on the list, it&#8217;s free, open source, and self-hosted.</p>
<p>X-Cart is often considered one of the fastest open source platforms on the market, and it also has an incredible number of features for you to sink your teeth into. There&#8217;s also a free trial for the premium plan, which goes for $495 (one-time payment).</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It depends on the package you go with, but you can often get full multilingual and multi-currency support.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s free and open source.</li>
<li>The most advanced developers will have all the control they need with X-Cart. It&#8217;s pretty fun to play around with.</li>
<li>You can integrate your shopping cart with the most reputable payment gateways in the world.</li>
<li>You can also rest easy knowing that X-Cart is completely secure and PCI Compliant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You have no access to direct customer support unless you pay an extra fee.</li>
<li>You even have to pay for hosting if you opt for one of the paid plans.</li>
<li>Although the premium plan is only $495 for a lifetime, this still looks somewhat high compared to other options.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll have to utilize some sort of manual coding when setting up your store.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Zen Cart</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13530" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="606" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-2.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Zen_Cart-300x280.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The whole reason Zen Cart was created was so that people without development degrees could build their own online stores.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say that you don&#8217;t need any coding knowledge, but it&#8217;s pretty close.</p>
<p>But, I can assure you this:</p>
<p>Zen Cart is more user-friendly than many of the other open source ecommerce platforms, so it might be worth looking into if you want to scale up quickly but you don&#8217;t have advanced skills.</p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zen Cart is known as a rather secure software, so you know that your site and customer information is protected.</li>
<li>Zen Cart is also great for scaling up a store because of its wide range of features and full customization options.</li>
<li>You can send out HTML emails directly from your website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides</h3>
<ul>
<li>The platform doesn&#8217;t provide any dedicated support.</li>
<li>It can sometimes be difficult to upgrade your software.</li>
<li>There aren&#8217;t many add-ons or extensions.</li>
<li>The templates are far from impressive, but you can still find some made by third parties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Magento Open Source</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13522" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="387" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-3.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Magento_Community_Edition-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Magento is one of the most popular open source ecommerce platforms, and for good reason.</p>
<p>To start, it has more features than you can ever expect to use. However, this opens up all sorts of avenues when it comes to marketing to your customers and creating things like membership plans, recurring payments, and discounts.</p>
<p>Do you seek complete control over the design and functionality of the site?</p>
<p>If the answer is a solid yes, consider Magento Open Source. It&#8217;s very similar to that of WordPress, where the community is strong, you can choose from hundreds of thousands of themes, and there are plenty of extensions to get your hands on.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s free, and there&#8217;s a paid version if you want to upgrade.</li>
<li>You almost never need to look for an extension with Magento, since the feature list is overwhelming.</li>
<li>You can send out product alerts to customers for automated marketing.</li>
<li>The platform lets you make separate multi-lingual sites that load up depending on the user&#8217;s location.</li>
<li>You can customize the user interface however you want.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Magento is packed with features, but that can also make it clunky and resource-hungry. Therefore, you might have to allocate a decent amount of money and time for optimization.</li>
<li>Although you can learn how to use Magento, the main reason you would consider it is if you had development skills. Larger companies are known to go with Magento because they have the access and money to get a developer who knows code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. OpenCart</h2>
<p>Compared to other open source platforms, OpenCart is actually pretty easy to use and lightweight. It&#8217;s free and there is a decent community to turn to if you have problems when designing your store.</p>
<p>I recommend it for startups since it doesn&#8217;t take too much time to customize the website from scratch.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13523" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-4.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="403" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-4.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/OpenCart-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Due to the ease of use, the overall cost of setting up a store typically decreases.</p>
<p>For instance, you don&#8217;t have to pay for a special developer, the themes aren&#8217;t expensive, and you definitely don&#8217;t need any plugins.</p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>The startup costs are pretty low.</li>
<li>The features are solid, and the large catalog functionality works wonders for order processing.</li>
<li>The average person should be fine with setting up OpenCart. Not to mention, it doesn&#8217;t suck down resources like Magento.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you look at the feature list of Magento compared to OpenCart, it&#8217;s no comparison. Magento wins by a landslide.</li>
<li>Performance is not a strong suit with OpenCart, so sometimes you have to get an extra plugin for this.</li>
<li>Although it&#8217;s easier to use for beginnners, this means that the customization options are also fewer. You might consider OpenCart as one of the few open source ecommerce platforms that experienced developers would rather avoid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. PrestaShop</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13525" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-5.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="401" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-5.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PrestaShop-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>PrestaShop is a somewhat new in the ecommerce platform game, but it&#8217;s made a name for itself with its ease of use and the beautiful interface. Another thing to consider is that it doesn&#8217;t take much experience to install the plugin.</p>
<p>Therefore, beginners and intermediates will find it pretty easy to get started.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>PrestaShop has a user-friendly interface with effortless inventory management and a process for store maintenance that anyone could understand.</li>
<li>PrestaShop provides a beautiful interface for establishing different websites for multiple languages and currencies.</li>
<li>This is a fairly lightweight ecommerce platform so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it slowing down your site or running slowly when you design the site on your computer.</li>
<li>It has multi-vendor support if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>PrestaShop isn&#8217;t as robust as other options like Magento, so the scalability isn&#8217;t quite there. You could expand into a large, international store using the software, if necessary. However, it&#8217;s really suited for small to mid-sized businesses.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not required to install any extra modules for a regular online store, but more often than not it seems like you&#8217;ll need to pay for some sort of extension. And they aren&#8217;t cheap.</li>
<li>The default theme provided isn&#8217;t nearly as nice looking as you would find on other open source software.</li>
<li>PrestaShop is a little lightweight in terms of marketing tools. For instance, you can&#8217;t cross-sell products (at the time of this article).</li>

<h2>7. osCommerce</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13524" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-6.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="248" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-6.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/osCommerce-300x114.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>With osCommerce, you have access to a thriving community of developers and users, with a wonderful forum to check out solutions to your problems and talk with other people. Almost 300,000 online stores are made with osCommerce, so you know there are plenty of companies that already find it suitable.</p>
<p>The pricing is obviously a plus since you don&#8217;t have to pay a dime to launch an online store. I would also give it top marks for the features, online support, and ease of use.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The online support is pretty amazing. Obviously, you&#8217;re not going to be getting direct support, but the osCommerce forum has millions of active conversations that you can search. You also have the option to share your own thoughts or questions.</li>
<li>Similar to WordPress, the strong community means that you also have access to many plugins and add-ons. Developers mostly give these out for free, but you&#8217;ll also find some that you have to pay for, or somewhere you might need to upgrade in order to get better features.</li>
<li>One of the great things about osCommerce is that it&#8217;s easy to open up and make more advanced customizations to. Even less experienced developers can go in there and make modifications rather easily. In addition, you shouldn&#8217;t have any problem finding and paying a developer to work with osCommerce.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The main reason you might consider going with something different like Magento is due to the reason that osCommerce isn&#8217;t known to scale that well. It&#8217;s entirely possible to make a larger ecommerce website, but I recommend it purely for small to midsized stores.</li>
<li>The osCommerce software requires more maintenance than other platforms. This means that you&#8217;ll have to spend more time making updates, keeping the site secure, and working on things like SEO.</li>
<li>Because of your ability to really play around with the code in osCommerce, it can be more prone to errors and breakages. You probably don&#8217;t want an ecommerce site to ever break, so it&#8217;s important to find an excellent developer who knows how to protect the site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. JigoShop</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13521" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-7.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="350" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-7.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JigoShop-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>JigoShop often gets compared to WooCommerce because of its ease of use and clean interface. You can also expand the functionality of the site with a wide range of plugins and add-ons, making your website far easier to scale up.</p>
<p>Overall, the development of JigoShop has improved over the years, so you&#8217;ll find that JigoShop is pretty easy to pick up, even as a beginner. You&#8217;ll find a basic dashboard, incredible themes (which are better than most themes from other platforms,) and a speedy interface when adding anything from products to promotions.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can&#8217;t find an easier to use open source ecommerce platform than this. Other than WooCommerce, this would also be on my list for beginners or intermediates.</li>
<li>You can choose from a large selection of themes, many of which are some of the best-looking themes on the market.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s fairly easy to edit the code for your site, and you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems finding a developer who&#8217;s comfortable with JigoShop.</li>
<li>The integrations are aplenty, similar to that of WordPress where you can search online for the type of add-ons you want and it returns dozens of solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t get any options for customer support. You&#8217;re left to the forums and blog posts online.</li>
<li>The initial feature set isn&#8217;t all that plentiful so you are expected to install some add-ons. Some of them are free, while others are not.</li>
<li>Although the themes look wonderful you&#8217;ll have a hard time locating themes for free. You can find some free solutions, but these are usually a little watered down. Therefore, if you go with JigoShop you should keep the theme expenses in your mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Drupal Commerce</h2>
<p>Drupal is one of the most common options to go with when designing any kind of website. It&#8217;s one of the close competitors of WordPress since a strong percentage of the internet is powered by Drupal.</p>
<p>Not to mention, you can make pretty much any type of website with it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13520" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-8.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="327" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-8.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Drupal_Commerce-300x151.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>As for Drupal Commerce, this is a separate module that allows you to build your ecommerce site rapidly, and it&#8217;s one of the best solutions if you plan on scaling up quickly.</p>
<p>The bonus is- there&#8217;s a huge community of people behind Drupal, so you can turn to the forums, social pages, and blogs for support.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drupal was designed with the idea that only professionals were going to use it. This is why if you&#8217;re a developer you&#8217;ll feel right at home. The initial goal of Drupal has carried over throughout the years and it&#8217;s one of the main reasons it&#8217;s so powerful.</li>
<li>It has built-in caching, so the overall speed and performance are much better than other open source ecommerce platforms.</li>
<li>Unlike many other free open source solutions, Drupal Commerce has its own security system built in. It also gets updated frequently so you should be fine when protecting your site.</li>
<li>The online community is always there to help you along your way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re going to have a tough time running an online store if you&#8217;re new to Drupal Commerce. It&#8217;s hard to learn and most of the discussion in the community is coming from more experienced developers.</li>
<li>Drupal Commerce websites can become resource hogs since they often turn into large sites with lots of components and modifications.</li>
<li>Even if you&#8217;re an experienced developer, you might find the interface to be complicated.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no chance of paying for a low price host with Drupal Commerce. You need high power and speed, preferably a VPS or dedicated server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. WP eCommerce</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13528" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-9.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="204" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-9.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WP_eCommerce-300x94.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>WP Ecommerce is the overshadowed cousin of WooCommerce. They&#8217;re not technically related at all, but it&#8217;s a solid WordPress plugin that doesn&#8217;t get nearly as much attention as WooCommerce.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how it works. First, you install WordPress on your hosting server, followed by the WP eCommerce plugin.</p>
<p>This transforms a regular WordPress dashboard into an ecommerce control center. So, you can add products, run promotions, create categories, and more.</p>
<p><em>As simple as that!</em></p>
<p>Smaller sites will be fine with the plugin, but you have to install paid add-ons for extra functionality.</p>
<h3>Benefits::</h3>
<ul>
<li>You actually get direct support if you pay for an add-on. Apparently, that support is only good for the add-on you purchased, but you might be able to get information out of a rep that&#8217;s not related.</li>
<li>The plugin supports about a dozen payment gateways, but WP eCommerce provides support if you need to go with a gateway that isn&#8217;t in the system.</li>
<li>The backend is easy to navigate and the frontend results look pretty clean and modern. What&#8217;s more is that you can customize all of this easily with some simple CSS and HTML.</li>
<li>You can pay for direct customer support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There aren&#8217;t many add-ons.</li>
<li>The multi-lingual tools are just okay. Apparently, there are more advanced multilingual and multi-currency tools coming in the near future, so I&#8217;ll see how that goes.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re not going to find nearly as many WordPress themes for WP eCommerce as you are for WooCommerce.</li>
</ul>
<h2>11. Ubercart</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13526" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-10.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="459" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/11-best-open-source-ecommerce-platforms-for-2017-10.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ubercart-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Ubercart is often compared to Drupal Commerce in blog posts.</p>
<p>Drupal Commerce was created by an old Ubercart developer. Therefore, many people argue that Ubercart is the best because it&#8217;s the original and has more features to play around with, while others state that Drupal Commerce is the more improved version of Ubercart.</p>
<p>This is what you can normally find when an employee leaves his or her company to create an own and fire up the competition.</p>
<p>But, there are significant differences, making it rather important to find the one that fits your business the best. It would be a pain to migrate from one to the other after making a wrong choice.</p>
<p>In short, both are highly customizable, but Drupal Commerce is more geared towards complex customizations. Most of the differences can be found in the extensions and add-ons, since some extensions just aren&#8217;t available in each library.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to research which add-ons are needed for your company before pulling the trigger on an ecommerce platform like this.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The activity logging in Ubercart is a fancy way to locate order statues no matter where a customer is in the purchasing process.</li>
<li>Although both Ubercart and Drupal Commerce are developer friendly, I&#8217;d argue that Ubercart is better for less experienced users.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s simple enough to work well for smaller stores, but you do have the capabilities to expand.</li>
<li>Payment modules and shipping options are all packaged into the open source ecommerce platform. Therefore, you don&#8217;t have to think much about that when launching.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Downsides:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The customization controls are less powerful in Ubercart when compared to Drupal Commerce. This can be a good thing for newer developers, but some more advanced users might want more.</li>
<li>Although you can scale up to support lots of products and product variants, Drupal Commerce is definitely more suitable for a large online store.</li>
<li>The SKUs are not as cut and dry as the competition, so users may have trouble when working with weight calculations for shipping.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is An Open Source Ecommerce Platform Right for You?</h2>
<p>I just want you to know that there are many other open source software which I haven&#8217;t mentioned.</p>
<p>The best part is every single one of these is free and constantly in development. That&#8217;s a huge plus if you&#8217;d like to save a little money in the short term and scale up easily in the long term.</p>
<p>Even though open source ecommerce platforms have their advantages, you should seriously consider a non-open source solution like Shopify, Bigcommerce, or Volusion. With these platforms you only pay a small monthly fee, you don&#8217;t have to maintain your site as much or look for hosting, and always get dedicated customer support.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this type of ecommerce frameworks is for rapidly scaling companies that are going to hire a developer (or a team of developers) to run the entire website. But if you don&#8217;t have the money for this type of employee, you&#8217;re better off scaling up with something like Shopify.</p>

				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>Building an ecommerce store is easy.</p>
<p>Getting people to buy is hard.</p>
<p><em>Or is it?</em></p>
<p><em>The fact is:</em></p>
<p>It all boils down to your customers.</p>
<p>This is how most marketers and business owners play it out:</p>
<p>They &#8216;think&#8217; that people would be interested in cat socks. No problem.</p>
<p>Then they <em>imagine</em> that girls in the age range of 8-16 would be interested in buying cat socks.</p>
<p>They build out an entire business targeting girls with an age range of 8-16. They then wonder why they&#8217;re not making sales.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue here is that the thought process is flawed.</p>
<p><em>Everything you see and hear </em>is<em> perspective.</em></p>
<p>Such perspectives may not be correct all the time. And building business based on perspectives is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Business and marketing business should be data-backed. You need real data showing you where and what your target audience is.</p>
<p>And in this post, I&#8217;m going to show you how to get that data- step by step.</p>
<p><span id="more-13581"></span></p>
<h2>The 3 Steps to Nailing Target Market Demographics</h2>
<p>Demographics are simply the statistical characteristics of a sample set of people. If you&#8217;re able to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>where your ideal customers hang out online</li>
<li>what they read</li>
<li>how they compare products, and</li>
<li>where they buy from</li>
</ul>
<p>you have an unfair advantage compared to your competitors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll cover the process of finding the ideal target market demographic for your ecommerce store in 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Start with the keywords</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, I might be a biased here, but think about it:</p>
<p>All search activity starts with a <strong>keyword.</strong></p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re trying to identify the target market demographic that&#8217;ll result in sales for your keyword, it&#8217;s only sensible that you start your research with keywords.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the bitcoin and cryptocurrency niche for example.</p>
<p>First, you need to so some KW research:</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use the free Google Keyword Planner:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13584" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="364" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/google-kwyord-planner-to-find-target-keywords-300x170.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/google-kwyord-planner-to-find-target-keywords-768x436.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/google-kwyord-planner-to-find-target-keywords-650x369.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just search for keyword ideas related to &#8216;bitcoin price&#8217; for now:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13587 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="860" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-1.jpg 762w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search-223x300.jpg 223w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search-768x1032.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search-650x873.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search.jpg 902w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This should pull some solid keyword ideas around the base keyword, that we can use for further research. And since we&#8217;re trying to uncover communities where our target customers hang out, let&#8217;s look for keywords that people might discuss in such communities:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13588" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-2.jpg" alt="bitcoin price keyword ideas GKP" width="640" height="792" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-2.jpg 827w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP-242x300.jpg 242w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP-768x951.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP-650x805.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP.jpg 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s time to find out where your target customers hang out, which is Step 2.</p>
<h3><strong>Forums</strong></h3>
<p>First, let&#8217;s do a google search for online communities around cat socks.</p>
<p>Simply run a google search with any of the following Google search operators:</p>
<p>keyword &#8220;forum&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by Fireboard&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by ip.board&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by phpbb&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by phpbb3&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by SMF&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by vbulletin&#8221;<br />
keyword forum<br />
keyword intitle:forum<br />
keyword inurl:forum</p>
<p>When I do a search for bitcoin price &#8220;forum&#8221;, it pulls up a number of forums with raging discussions on bitcoin price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, make sure you install the SEO quake chrome extension, which has a great SERP overlay feature that shows you how much Semrush traffic each forum gets directly from the SERPs:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13589" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-3.jpg" alt="bitcoin price forums search" width="640" height="507" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-3.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-forums-search-300x238.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-forums-search-768x608.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-forums-search-650x515.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I prefer to choose forums that get at least 50K searches for competitive niches like bitcoin, and at least 20k for moderate yet awesome niches like cat socks &#x1f642;</p>
<p>Now, go ahead and signup to 4 of the best forums you can find from the SERPs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Bonus Tip: </strong>Since I like to do this once in a while to identify new interests and market demographics, I create a separate Google chrome user and signup to forums in that niche using that user account. This way, I just have to open that chrome user window anytime I want to do research.</em></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve created accounts on 4 of the best forums you can find this way, login to the none by one and spend some time in each of them.</p>
<p>And these are our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>look for relevant threads and find the pain points for people in the niche that we can try to solve</li>
<li>find the characteristics of people sharing their problems in the forums</li>
<li>note anything else that can help us</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I just logged into Bitcointalk.org, one of the prominent forums in the bitcoin niche, and found this relevant thread:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13590 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-4.jpg" alt="bitcoin thread" width="2760" height="1054" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-4.jpg 2760w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-300x115.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-768x293.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-1024x391.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-650x248.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 2760px) 100vw, 2760px" /></p>
<p>There are several insights in the first page alone (there are 28 pages full of comments):</p>
<ol>
<li>Users frequent preev.com and epsilon.one to check prices.</li>
<li>Some users use alert services to keep track of prices</li>
<li>Some users hold multiple cryptocurrencies and check the prices of those too.</li>
<li>The users who check for bitcoin prices the most are traders who do short-term or scalp trading.</li>
<li>Some users are crazy about checking BTC prices all the time</li>
</ol>
<p>Whoa! Those were new insights even for me. To be frank, I check BTC prices daily too, and I&#8217;ve never even heard of preev.com and epsilon.one.</p>
<p>Although we can take a look at the forum profiles of the members who posted these comments, I generally don&#8217;t trust forum profile data. For uncovering demographic and user data, let&#8217;s take a look at relevant Facebook groups.</p>
<h3><strong>Facebook Groups</strong></h3>
<p>Login to Facebook, and search for Bitcoin price forums.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13591" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-5.jpg" alt="bitcoin_price fb groups" width="640" height="694" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-5.jpg 945w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups-277x300.jpg 277w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups-768x832.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups-650x704.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups.jpg 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Join the top 3 and look around just like you did on forums.</p>
<p>Now, onto the final step:</p>
<p><strong>The grunt work begins:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this step is not to identify topics or pain points of BTC enthusiasts. It&#8217;s to identify the characteristics of users who are interested in constant price checking.</p>
<p>First, start looking at posts from at least a month back in these groups and list down (or open in new tabs) profiles of actual users who talk about bitcoin prices. Don&#8217;t check profiles of the folks sharing price update links (these are marketers like you and me :))</p>
<p>Next, there are two plays you can use:</p>
<p>Open each profile and look for commonalities in characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is he/she a millennial?</li>
<li>Are they working?</li>
<li>What profile/field do they work in?</li>
<li>Are they active on Facebook (check their timelines)?</li>
<li>Have they listed any other websites/social profiles in their about section?</li>
<li>Any websites/blogs they share regularly (this one is gold)</li>
</ul>
<p>I typically just create a Google sheet and list the profile links of at least 50 users who look like my target customer/user.</p>
<p>I then create columns for each of the above data points and fill them one by one.</p>
<p>Well, actually &#8211; I just list the profile links and get my VA to fill them out &#x1f642;</p>
<p>And to be brutally frank, I just scrape the user list from groups and copy/paste them into a Google sheet, but that strategy is for another day &#x1f642;</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done, you should have a hardcore DB of target users and some solid data on them.</p>
<p>These are the data points that I pay most attention to for ecommerce stores:</p>
<ol>
<li>Job profiles (are they working and where?)</li>
<li>Age ranges</li>
<li>Facebook activity</li>
<li>Blogs/websites they share regularly</li>
</ol>
<p>50 is just a target for you to get started. There is nothing wrong with having a considerably larger list.</p>
<p>The more data we have, the more accurate the commonalities we find will be.</p>
<p>Just take a look at the data you&#8217;ve collected from user profiles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the data I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most users are from the US and Russia.</li>
<li>Most are millennials and in the age range of 25-36</li>
<li>Most of them are not active on Facebook (duh)</li>
<li>They share price update posts about sudden crypto price spikes</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you get where we&#8217;re getting to? All the above points are demographics &#x1f600;</p>
<p>You can target users on almost any paid platform using all this data, and we now also know the interests of people interested in the &#8216;bitcoin price&#8217; niche.</p>
<p>Wondering how all that insight will help us craft a content strategy for our store (or blog in this example)?</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how:</strong></p>
<p>-they like to read price updates multiple times a day- which means you should try to push out atleast 2 posts on price updates every day</p>
<p>-Our target market demographic includes millennials, so use millenial-targeted copy for your ads and CTAs.</p>
<p>-Publish guest posts on websites frequented by target audience</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Want to take it a step further?</strong></h3>
<p>What if I told you that you can outreach to your target users and invite them to surveys so that you can gather data at scale?</p>
<p>And this is how you can do it:</p>
<p>After you create a list (or scrape) of users fitting your ideal customer/user persona, send them a message on Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>Do not invite them to an interview or survey straight away.</p>
<p>Start with a personalized question like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hey {{Name}},</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Noticed that you&#8217;re active in the group. Thought I&#8217;d reach out and connect. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What websites do you use to keep track of the price?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>If they reply, respond with this message:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks a ton {{Name}}!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m actually thinking about starting a BTC blog- I spend most of my time reading about it anyway.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>However, I&#8217;ve no idea about what our community may be looking for online, so I put together a short </em>2-minute questionnaire<em> to find out.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Do you mind spending 2 minutes to fill it out: <strong>Questionnaire link.</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you&#8217;re too busy, I understand &#x1f642;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks again,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>{{Your name}}</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wondering how to set up the questionnaire? You should be easily able to set one up for free using TypeForm.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13592" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.png" alt="typeform questionnaire example" width="640" height="411" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.png 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/typeform-example-300x193.png 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/typeform-example-768x493.png 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/typeform-example-650x417.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>And I&#8217;m lazier than you, so I also set up a Zapier integration so that every single time someone fills out and submits a questionnaire, it gets added to a Google sheet as a new row.</p>
<p>Nifty, huh?</p>
<h2><strong>Going all in- In-Depth Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>Warning: this strategy may not be well suited for well-known niches.</p>
<p>But for cases where target users may not be very active online, or where you need more granular and in-depth demographic data, it&#8217;s actually a good idea to physically interact with actual customers!</p>
<p>The folks over at Food On the Table (now Genius Kitchen) created the first version of their website after they followed an actaul mom around for three staggering weeks to understand her shopping and buying habits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13593" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-6.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="393" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-6.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Genius-Kitchen-300x184.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Genius-Kitchen-768x471.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Genius-Kitchen-650x399.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Food on the Table now has over a million users. That&#8217;s the grunt work paying off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I sign off, there are 3 key points to remember:</p>
<p>-this is the step in researching and finding your target market. Set aside some time for it.</p>
<p>-forums are a goldmine (or bitcoin mine lol) of data about your target market demographic andaudience. Don&#8217;t avoid them because you hate creating accounts</p>
<p>-grunt work really pays off &#x1f642;</p>

				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>Some online businesses grow fast.</p>
<p>In such situations, inventory management becomes a problem, since it&#8217;s quite hard to keep up with rapidly growing demand for the products.</p>
<p>In addition to that, a brand like this is often selling on multiple channels such as Amazon, Etsy, eBay, or with a physical retail store.</p>
<p>But, here&#8217;s some food for thought:</p>
<p>Can you imagine the level of management required for the business to run smooth as silk?</p>
<p>The manpower, the resources, and not to mention, the time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Stitch Labs comes into the picture.<span id="more-13452"></span></p>

<p>In this Stich Labs Review, I&#8217;ll cover the most basic features, along with the tools that work best for advanced users.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also be surprised to know that even the smaller Stich Labs pricing plans have robust tools like order importing, channel syncing, Amazon FBA support, and sales velocity reporting.</p>
<p>Additionally, the more advanced users and the fastest growing companies can take advantage of dedicated account reps, API access, and third-party logistics integrations.</p>
<p>With the ability to add new sales channels at any time, take advantage of advanced order fulfillment, and strive for omnichannel growth.</p>
<p>The Stitch Labs software is definitely worth looking into. Read about it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stitch Labs Review &#8211; Standout Features</h2>
<h3>Automated Syncing Across Multiple Channels</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13453 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands.jpg" alt="stitch labs review" width="650" height="415" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Automated_Stick_Syncing_Across_Multiple_Channels-300x192.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Automated_Stick_Syncing_Across_Multiple_Channels-150x96.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say your company uses the following sales channels: a Shopify website, Amazon, and a POS in your physical retail shop. This makes it somewhat difficult to sync up all of those sales in real-time and make sure that you don&#8217;t run out of inventory in a high sales environment.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best part- Stitch Labs brings all of these channels together in one dashboard.</p>
<p>The stock is synced together automatically, so you can see things like how much of the inventory is committed to Amazon, the retail store, and your online shop. This allows you to understand where the inventory is going so you can reorder items and increase your revenue along the way.</p>
<p>Overall, the point is to avoid those costly out-of-stock items and give customers what they want.</p>
<h3>Real-time Data to Reduce Inventory Risk</h3>
<p>The advantage of real-time data revolves around your company as a fast-growing brand. You can&#8217;t wait a day or two to see accurate data, so Stitch Labs delivers the right information immediately.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13455" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands-1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="475" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands-1.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Real-time_Data_to_Reduce_Inventory_Risk-300x219.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Real-time_Data_to_Reduce_Inventory_Risk-150x110.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to see metrics like units sold, total orders, number of orders, and unique customers, while also breaking down the sales throughout the year.</p>
<p>This gives you a deeper understanding of your products and the performances from each channel, not to mention, the capability to make better decisions with relevant data.</p>
<h3>Sales Velocity and Stockout Date Reports</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13456" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="340" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands-2.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sales_velocity-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sales_velocity-150x78.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The sales velocity report is one of my favorite modules in Stitch Labs since it helps your company understand how quickly your products are flying off the shelves. The lead time and stock out information are displayed right on the report, and it even shows how much of a safety buffer you have until one of your customers gets mad because of no stock.</p>
<p>Data is beautiful indeed.</p>
<h3>Awesome Order Fulfillment Tools (Multi-channel Support)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13454" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands-3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="576" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/stitch-labs-review-omni-channel-inventory-management-for-high-growth-brands-3.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Awesome_Order_Fulfillment_Tools-300x266.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Awesome_Order_Fulfillment_Tools-150x133.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Another great way to meet customer demands and reduce costs with Stitch Labs is by using the order management and fulfillment tool. This gem streamlines the process across all of your sales channels. It connects these communications to warehouses, dropshippers, or whoever else is involved in the process.</p>
<h2>Customer Support and More</h2>
<p>Since Stitch Labs assumes your business is growing fast, it makes sure that it has the right amount of customer support at your fingertips.</p>
<p>All pricing plans get support through live chat, email, and phone. In my opinion, this is more than enough, but Stitch Labs takes it further with a dedicated account manager in some plans.</p>
<p>Bonus: there&#8217;s a Stitch Labs blog and several eBooks, guides, webinars, and customer stories on the website.</p>
<h2>Stitch Labs Pricing</h2>
<p>The Stitch Labs pricing depends on your order volume, making it much easier for companies to save money and get the support they actually need.</p>
<p>For example, you won&#8217;t get stuck paying too much for a plan just because you need one extra feature. It&#8217;s all based on the order volume; this setup is quite nice because companies with rapid growth can quickly upgrade as they hit new milestones.</p>
<p>So how do you choose the right plan?</p>
<p>The answer is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>First, you specify your order volume, then you choose a package with certain features.</p>
<p>As an example, let&#8217;s assume that your monthly order volume is approximately 2,000 orders per month. With that order volume, you&#8217;d be able to choose between the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Package</strong> &#8211; $499 per month for unlimited sales channels, two partner integrations, unlimited users, Master of Stock channel syncing, historical order import, purchase orders, publishing listings, support (through email, live chat and phone,) dashboard reports, Amazon FBA support, implementation services, sales velocity reporting, bundling, user permission, multi-warehousing, barcode printing and scanning, and more.</li>
<li><strong>High-growth Package</strong> &#8211; $799 per month for unlimited sales channels, unlimited partner integrations, everything from the previous plan, and third-party logistics integrations, a smart replenish feature and EDI integration.</li>
<li><strong>Premium Package</strong> &#8211; For this one, you have to call for pricing, but the point is to scale your business with the help of advanced functionality and customization options. You get everything from the previous plans, along with API access and priority access to new features. You also receive a dedicated account manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you move on past the 2,000 order mark, the packages stay the same, but the pricing goes up a little for those packages.</p>
<p>The order ranges include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;2,000 orders per month.</li>
<li>2,001-5,000 orders per month.</li>
<li>5,000-10,000 orders per month.</li>
<li>10,000 + orders per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#8217;s more is that you can request a full Stitch Labs demo if you&#8217;re not exactly sure which features are right for your brand.</p>
<h2>Are There Any Stitch Labs Alternatives?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re running a small scale business while reading this, this question might have struck you already.</p>
<p>Some startups and smaller companies won&#8217;t even think about implementing Stitch Labs because of their smaller budgets.</p>
<p>The thing is, you would be able to find a number of software that seems like Stitch Labs alternatives.</p>
<p>However, once your company reaches a point of rapid growth, and you&#8217;ve expanded to multiple sales channels (like Amazon or a retail store), it&#8217;d be wise if you switch over to Stitch Labs.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Why hire many managers when you have the all-in-one package waiting right in front of you?</p>

<p class="p1">Digital commerce continues to be top of mind for online retailers.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Consumers shop more and more across a variety of devices and channels.</li>
<li class="p1">Retailers continually optimize their sales channels to deliver more seamless consumer experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">But within this focus on digital commerce is also increasing pressure from fraudulent activities.  </p>
<p class="p1">According to a recent survey of North American digital enablers (e.g., ecommerce platform providers) commissioned by Discover® Global Network, <strong>mid-sized merchants with annual revenues of $250 million to $1 billion are seen as the most high-risk targets for fraud over the next 12-24 months</strong>.<sup><span class="s1">1</span></sup></p>
<p class="p1">This risk for mid-sized merchants could be caused by two factors.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">First, fraudsters likely see mid-sized merchants as having enough revenue and customer volume to make attacks worthwhile.</li>
<li class="p1">Second, mid-sized merchants often lack the necessary complex risk management systems used by larger digital commerce companies that would help thwart fraud.<sup><span class="s1">1</span></sup></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">There’s not much you can do about factor #1, and that makes the second factor here incredibly important.</p>

<p class="p1">As digital commerce continues to grow, so do new methods to commit fraud.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Let’s look at a few of those –– and what you can proactively do about it.</p>
<h2 class="p4">New Payment Methods, New Fraudulent Activity</h2>
<p class="p1">The method in which consumers shop is continually evolving.</p>
<p class="p1">Take digital commerce, for example. In 2016, shoppers spent more than $1.9 trillion worldwide.<sup><span class="s1">2</span></sup></p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Some estimates project that global ecommerce sales will reach $4 trillion by the year 2020.<sup><span class="s1">2</span></sup></p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Mobile payments are also making an increasing impact. This shift to mobile is pushed along with the ever expanding list of payments-enabled devices.</p>
<p class="p1">Consumers can now pay with:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Their phone and apps</li>
<li class="p1">Smartwatches</li>
<li class="p1">Voice-activated assistants</li>
<li class="p1">Connected cars  </li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The list goes on.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, in the U.S., 28% of millennials prefer shopping on their smartphones (a mobile device) rather than on their computers.<sup><span class="s1">3</span></sup></p>
<p class="p1">Not only is mobile building amongst consumers, but retailers see the importance of incorporating a digital payments and mobile strategy throughout their business to potentially capture a greater share of wallet.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This shift towards m-commerce is predicted to reach $284 billion, or 45% of the total U.S. ecommerce market by 2020.<sup><span class="s1">4</span></sup></p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">And the use of mobile payments is expected to grow at an 80% compound annual growth rate through 2020 — reaching $503 billion.<sup><span class="s1">5</span></sup></p>
<p class="p1">Within this evolution into digital commerce are new payment technologies that aim to meet the needs and expectations for a more seamless, secure and immediate payments experience.</p>
<p class="p1">Currently, examples of prominent payment technologies include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Digital wallets</strong> – apps that store credit card information on a mobile device—be it phone, smart watch or other payments enabled devices. Common examples are Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay; but individual companies have also begun developing their own branded digital wallet.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hybrid online-mobile systems</strong> – the use of a personal computer and mobile device, which enables consumers to do things like authenticate an online purchase through their mobile device.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>EMV technology</strong> – a chip embedded within credit and debit cards that is generally harder to clone than the traditional magnetic strip of a card. EMV chips create data unique to each transaction, which make card validation possible for each transaction.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Contactless payments</strong> – technology that allows consumers to hold their payment method of choice (e.g., mobile device) near the merchant point-of-sale terminal to complete a transaction, as opposed to inserting or swiping a card.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">However, the rewards of new payment technologies, like faster transactions through digital wallets, and the shift towards new preferred methods of paying also come with new challenges.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Common challenges include consumer adoption.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Retailers generally want their consumers to adopt new technology before considering investing expenses and effort to support it.</p>
<p class="p1">However, until retailers support a technology, it is difficult to demonstrate an interest.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Another challenge:</strong> retailers and issuers need to communicate with employees and consumers about how to complete transactions on new technologies and systems.</p>
<p class="p1">A notable risk of these challenges: card-not-present fraud.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s start from the beginning here.</p>
<h2 class="p4">What is CNP Fraud?</h2>
<p class="p1">Card-not-present (CNP) transactions are when the consumer does not or cannot present their physical card to the merchant at the point-of-sale.</p>
<p class="p1">An ecommerce site is a common example in which this is the case.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, CNP fraud is when a consumer’s credit card is used to make a fraudulent transaction in a CNP setting.</p>
<h2 class="p4">The State of CNP Fraud</h2>
<p class="p1">CNP fraud is likely to become more prevalent as emerging payments technologies gain wider acceptance and as consumer preference for digital methods continues to grow.</p>
<p class="p1">And digital enablers would agree.</p>
<p class="p1">In the same survey of North American digital enablers commissioned by Discover Global Network, 62% of digital enabler respondents cited an increase in fraud year over year. This fraud occurred among their merchant customers, with one in five noting the increase as significant.<span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1">These results are not surprising, as similar trends continue to be reported on.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In 2016, one research and advisory firm predicted CNP fraud will exceed $7.2 billion in the U.S. by 2020, which, according to the report, is a 225% increase from 2015 levels.<sup><span class="s1">6</span></sup></p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">With so much value lost to fraudulent activities, where are these attempts coming from?</p>
<p class="p1">Some common examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hacking and data breaches</strong> – When a data breach occurs, user credentials and payment information can be attained. This information can end up on the dark web and, subsequently, bought by fraudsters.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Bots</strong> – Fraudsters use bots as a way to more easily and efficiently test stolen data across digital commerce sites.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Phishing attacks</strong> – Phishing is a common fraud method in which a fake communications are sent by a seemingly legitimate “company” in an effort to get consumers to enter in sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Other examples include malware, new account fraud, digital wallet fraud, account takeover and many more.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Regardless of the method, though, one thing is certain:</strong> Fraud will likely continue to grow.</p>
<h2 class="p4">CNP Fraud Likely to Grow</h2>
<p class="p1">CNP fraud is commonly associated with the implementation of EMV technology as merchants across the U.S. upgrade their point-of-sale terminals.</p>
<p class="p1">And though EMV technology will and has likely given rise to an increase in CNP fraud, other factors may be contributing to CNP fraud growth too.</p>
<p class="p1">One such potential factor is the continued growth of digital commerce, because as purchase volumes in digital channels continue to grow in value, so does the potential reward for fraudsters.</p>
<p class="p1">And digital commerce is growing.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">According to the U.S. Department of Commerce Census Bureau, U.S. retail ecommerce sales have increased by 15.5% from Q3 2016 to Q3 2017.<sup><span class="s1">4</span></sup></p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This upward trend has been present since at least 2008, when the Census Bureau reported that ecommerce sales accounted for about 3.5% of total sales, compared to now were ecommerce accounts for about 8.4% of total sales.<sup><span class="s1">7</span></sup></p>
<h2 class="p4">Authentication Strategies for Managing CNP Fraud</h2>
<p class="p1">To better manage CNP risk in the new payment frontier, among other methods, merchants could consider embracing a holistic solution that includes:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Layered security</li>
<li class="p1">Collaborative security</li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s2"> </span>Consumer-centric security</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p5">1. Layered Security.<span class="s3"><br /> </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Layered security is when the payments network, the issuer and the merchant all perform separate aspects of risk analysis and notify one another of potential events.</p>
<p class="p1">Since each respective player has different levels of information throughout the full transaction process, this method has inherent potential to be more effective than just one party performing a risk analysis by itself.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Large online retailers have incorporated a variety of authentication services as part of their layered security.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Some real-time services and tactics include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Device IDs</li>
<li class="p1">Fingerprint identification</li>
<li class="p1">Sophisticated rules engines</li>
<li class="p1">The 3-Domain Secure protocol</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">During pre-transaction activity, retailers have used predictive analytics that can help determine whether the consumer is an actual consumer versus a bot or fraudster.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Knowing the nature of the transaction helps the retailer permit only transactions that seem legitimate.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Layered security, broadly, can be implemented to help detect fraud throughout the entire payments chain—that is, before, during and after transaction authorization.</p>
<h3 class="p5">2. Collaborative Security</h3>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Collaboration across the entire payments ecosystem is critical.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Retailers who partner with networks, issuers and even other retailers to extend the benefits of security best practices and insights could potentially have more effective anti-fraud security measures than those who do not engage in a collaborative approach.</p>
<p class="p1">And this is important to having a strong layered security.</p>
<h3 class="p5">3. Consumer-centric Security.</h3>
<p class="p1">Of course, key to any strategy is keeping the consumer at the center of it all.</p>
<p class="p1">If a security strategy disrupts the consumer experience by being slow or complex, consumers could be frustrated and go elsewhere.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">But fortunately, anti-fraud tools continue to evolve into being more transparent and more frictionless for consumers.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Take mobile devices, for instance, and the implementation of biometrics to authorize payments.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of the security strategy, retailers should take a pragmatic approach by weighing risks versus sales in context.</p>
<p class="p1">From there, retailers need to determine if the hard losses avoid through fraud prevention will balance out the unrealized margin due to potential incomplete purchases.</p>
<h2 class="p4">What Next?</h2>
<p class="p1">As it stands, retailers must understand the current payments environment, implement current and evolving best practices to help reduce risk, increase consumer satisfaction, and plan for the future direction of transactions.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It is not necessarily an easy task, and it can be a continual process in this shifting payments landscape.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">An effective approach is to work with partners who are already experienced with the latest payment technologies, including fraud service providers, issuers, and leading payments networks.</p>

				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>If you&#8217;re an ecommerce professional and have tried to expand to a retail store or an online marketplace like Etsy or Amazon, you would know how complicated the process can get.</p>
<p>A lot of things can go wrong.</p>
<p>You end up having miscommunications on inventory between the channels, customers get upset when the inventory isn&#8217;t available, and the order management isn&#8217;t exactly as easy as it is with an individual online shop.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to find a multichannel solution like Primaseller.<span id="more-13510"></span></p>
<p>In this Primaseller review, we&#8217;ll outline the pricing of the platform, how it can help you with your online sales, and which features make it a bang for your buck.</p>
<p>But overall, Primaseller taps into your multichannel sales network to bring it all together in one seamless operation. The pricing looks reasonable, and you get to rely on the powerful inventory management tools, along with features for point of sales, inventory control, order management, purchase management, and B2B selling.</p>
<p>The integrations offered are impressive.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you want your sales network to be impressive as well?</p>
<p>I bet you do.</p>
<p>So stick with me here as I show you how it can enhance your online store with this comprehensive review.</p>
<h2>Integrations Galore</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13515" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="356" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Primaseller_review_-_integrations-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>From marketplaces to ecommerce platforms, and shippers to accounting tools, Primaseller does a wonderful job of integrating with a wide range of other programs.</p>
<p>For instance, when you look at the marketplaces that integrate with Primaseller you start to notice that there are pretty much no marketplaces left out. The major ones like Amazon, eBay and Etsy are all there.</p>
<p>In addition to those, you&#8217;ll also find country-specific domains of these marketplaces like Amazon Italy and eBay Singapore.</p>
<p>Some of the online stores that integrate with Primaseller include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Bigcommerce</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll also be glad to hear that you can link up to shipping accounts from USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL Express, and more.</p>
<p>Finally, payment and accounting software is supported through Primaseller. Some of the integrations are QuickBooks, Xero, Vantiv, and Clearant.</p>
<h2>How Can Primaseller Inventory Management Help?</h2>
<p>When you launch Primaseller, it prompts you to link up to your online store. Therefore, you get to specify whether you&#8217;re using a Bigcommerce, Magento, Shopify, or WooCommerce store.</p>
<p>Assuming you already have products in the store and you&#8217;ve started with some of the other channels (like Amazon or Etsy,) you can then proceed by linking up those accounts to Primaseller.</p>
<p>For instance, I&#8217;m selling on my Shopify store, along with eBay and Amazon. As long as I have accounts configured for all of those, Primaseller can pull it all into the dashboard.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sound impressive?</p>
<p>The main reason Primaseller can help you out is because of the well-organized inventory management.</p>
<p>The dashboard reveals all of the products you have in stock, along with metrics like damaged items and backorders. You can add stock directly from that page while also adjusting the number of items you have in stock.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13512 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-1.jpg" alt="primaseller review" width="650" height="285" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-1.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inventory_control-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great part is that all of the inventory is automatically tracked when sales are made, regardless of the channel being used.</p>
<p>It means that you won&#8217;t have to double check the total number of sales made on Amazon, eBay, and your store and hope that you have enough inventory for all of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13513" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="307" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-2.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inventory_control_001-300x142.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also set re-order thresholds so that you never run out of stock on an item.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13511" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="411" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-3.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/b2b-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Next up is the order and purchase management, where orders from different sources get consolidated into one sleek page. All of these integrate into the inventory control since you get the low stock alerts and automatically send out purchase orders.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more is that Primaseller provides a retail POS software that syncs with your online sales.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13514" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-4.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="282" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/primaseller-review-multi-channel-inventory-and-sales-management-without-the-high-price-tag-4.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pos-300x130.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all cloud-based, so orders that come in from Amazon are also combined with the retail sales, keeping your inventory in check and your customers happy. The POS allows for the use of portable devices such as iPads, phones, or laptops, expanding your ability to take orders on all devices.</p>
<h2>Primaseller Pricing</h2>
<p>Primaseller starts you off with a 14-day free trial. This way, you have a chance to test out the platform before committing to a pricing plan.</p>
<p>After that trial is over, you can choose from one of four pricing packages, the cheapest one being $59 per month. For some smaller startups, this might sound steep, but it&#8217;s actually a steal considering the number of features you receive. In addition to that, you&#8217;re bound to recoup your money (and more) since your multi-channel selling process will be streamlined and make customers even happier.</p>
<p>As for the plans, here&#8217;s what you have to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner</strong> &#8211; $59 per month provides support for one POS store, all integrations, 300 online orders per month, three users, no warehouses, 5,000 SKUs, purchase orders, accounting integration, shipper management, B2B orders, and the option to add on a B2B portal.</li>
<li><strong>Professional</strong> &#8211; $99 per month provides support for two POS stores, all online integrations, 900 orders per month, 10 users, one warehouse, 10,000 SKUs, everything from the previous plan, multi-location support, and composite SKUs.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced</strong> &#8211; $299 per month provides support for five POS stores, all online integrations, 3,000 orders per month, 20 users, three warehouses, 30,000 SKUs, everything from the previous plan, API access, and auto purchase order.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise</strong> &#8211; This plan requires you to request a quote, but everything from the previous plans is included. In addition, you get to customize things like how many POS stores you need support for and how many online orders you need per month.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Has This Primaseller Review Provided You with the Best Solution?</h2>
<p>With the superior Primaseller inventory management, the solid Primaseller pricing, and the overall ease of use in the system, I&#8217;d certainly recommend Primaseller if you manage an online store.</p>
<p>At some point, you&#8217;re going to want to expand sales through places like Amazon, Etsy, eBay, or a retail store. The only problem is that managing inventory and sending out orders becomes far too complicated without the in-built capabilities of a tool like Primaseller.</p>
<p>Considering costs, it&#8217;s cheap enough for the startups, and the company has plenty of tools for larger companies.</p>
<p><em>It doesn&#8217;t matter what the size of your store is- small, medium or large, you should get this!</em></p>
