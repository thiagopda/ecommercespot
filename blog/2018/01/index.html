<p>If you thought that choosing the right product was more than enough, think again.</p>
<p>Photos define the product and show a potential customer a plethora of things &#8211; the uses for the product, the demographics of the people who use the product, the feelings associated with it, and of course, the perceived value of the product.</p>
<p>But, there’s more to this than meets the eye.<span id="more-14236"></span></p>
<p>Believe it or not, even the most effortless product photos require so much effort. This is because a product photo conveys so much more than the product itself.</p>
<p>Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder but in this case, you get to choose what your customers will see.</p>
<p>I welcome you to the wonderful world of product photography!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started with the basics.</p>
<h2><strong>How To Take Product Photos</strong></h2>
<p>Many fall into the trap of just ticking boxes in their quest to getting the best photos of their product taken. It takes more than this.</p>
<p>Carefully planning out the theme of your photo shoot or pictorial should be part of the process, and before you can do this, your branding has to be set straight. If your product photo is not passing along the message of your brand then you clearly have to take a step back and replan.</p>
<p>Make sure that the theme is in line with what your company, business or enterprise stands for because a properly executed photo shoot can be an extension of your whole company image.</p>
<p>You’ve heard the saying “cut once measure twice”? It’s the same concept here, shoot once plan twice. Photography is a business expense that can easily cost you a lot of money so proper planning will save you money in the long run.</p>
<h2><strong>The Message You Want To Convey</strong></h2>
<p>This all boils down to the personality you want your product to have. Yes, it&#8217;s as important as determining a price for your product.</p>
<p>Think about this for a while.</p>
<p>It’s called <em>product positioning</em>.</p>
<p>Do you want it to look like the best thing since sliced bread, or would you want it to be sophisticated and chic? Perhaps, you’d want the fun side of your offering presented?</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you want. But, what really matters is that you have it all planned out before you even start the photo shoot.</p>
<h2><strong>The Subject</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14241 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals.jpg" alt="product photography lighting technique" width="1920" height="1279" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>There are plenty of ways for you to present your product photo.</p>
<p>One simple method involves displaying your offerings as a singular product in front of a white background. Do scale photographs to give the viewer a sense of the size of your offerings and you can use close-ups to highlight particular details.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>Remember when we talked about the message that you want to convey with your photograph? This is where you can throw everything you know about the studio, out through that window.</p>
<p>Lifestyle shots are a great way to show your product in action.However, they might be trickier to do because you don’t control all the variables like a studio, but they really drive your brand image across.</p>
<p>Group shots are another way to present how your product integrates with the rest of the products in your portfolio. If you have different variations of the product i.e. different colors, or sizes, you’ll give the potential customer an easier time comparing.</p>
<p>Don’t forget the packaging too!</p>
<p>Great products are always presented well and that should be your goal. As much as a consumer is excited about the product itself, the packaging can make a difference. Remember how many YouTube channels rose to fame because of unboxing videos?</p>
<p><strong>So, are you ready?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have all the planning laid out, it’s time for us to start the photoshoot! The following steps are a quick guide for you to set everything up, it covers everything from your lighting to prep!</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Started: Prep</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure that you have more than one of the item you’re photographing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If something happens to it, it would be relieving to know that you have a backup.</p>
<p>Prep the item beforehand. Did you know that those food photos you see from restaurants aren’t real food most of the time?</p>
<p>Looking for that refreshing look? Get a spray gun and mist your product. (Not advisable for electronics mind you.) Want that “sizzle” effect? Get a vaporizer or a smoke machine and give it that mysterious air.</p>
<p>Want to have a little <em>more</em> fun?</p>
<p>Make your product levitate with a thin piece of string and get rid of the string during this stage.</p>
<p>Like we said, product photography is a great time for you to unleash your creativity on all cylinders!</p>
<h2><strong>The Perfect Camera?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14238" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-1.jpg" alt="Camera lens" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-1.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>If you have the money, get the best camera that you can. At the end of the day, it’s a worthwhile investment especially if you’re planning to take a lot of photos or if you have a wide product inventory that you have to get on an ecommerce platform.</p>
<p>If you still can’t afford to invest in the best camera ever made then you can always borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>But, hold your horses.</p>
<p>If you are truly looking for the most affordable product photography options, don’t discount that little technological marvel in your pocket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14242" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-2.jpg" alt="iphone camera" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-2.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes the hardware on your seemingly regular smartphone can do the trick, but make sure it takes clear photos!</p>
<p>So once you’ve got your camera, I have a few more tips to share with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aperture size matters, smaller apertures will keep your product in focus, wider ones will create a distortion effect. Don’t dismiss the distortion effect if you’re eyeing some creative shots though.</li>
<li>White balance has to be consistent with the product photography lighting set up (more on this later) that you have in the photo shoot location.</li>
<li>As per ISO, experiment with this because it&#8217;s dependent on your lighting needs. Remember, too much ISO results in noise in most cases.</li>
<li>Different lenses for different purposes. You don’t need a telescopic lens unless you’re photographing your product from a mile away. Don’t use macro lenses unless you’re selling something tiny.</li>
<li>Shutter speed affects light, so depending on how much exposure you need to adjust accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn’t it easier to use your phone sometimes?</p>
<h2><strong>A Tripod To Hold It Still</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14243" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-3.jpg" alt="tripod for camera" width="1513" height="1920" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-3.jpg 1513w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-236x300.jpg 236w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-768x975.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-807x1024.jpg 807w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-650x825.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1513px) 100vw, 1513px" /></p>
<p>If you are taking a photograph of a stationary object, your camera has to be stationary as well.</p>
<p>Why? Because movement creates blurriness and distortion.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of tripods available and at best guess, you will just need one of those regular ones that they sell in camera stores. You could get a fancier setup which would cost more, or a monopod if you plan on doing other things with it after the shoot, but a tripod should be enough for now.</p>
<p>A good tripod is also a sound investment like a camera; they last for years and they rarely go out of date.</p>
<p>Want to know the best part?</p>
<p>You can even use your tripod for personal purposes, think about all those professional looking photos you can take with your friends and family.</p>
<h2><strong>Product Photography Lighting Techniques</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14240" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-4.jpg" alt="photography studio" width="1920" height="1079" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-4.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-650x365.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>You have plenty of options for lighting but that doesn’t mean you should rush out and get yourself studio-grade lighting equipment. You can get yourself a lightbox, which can disperse light evenly and minimize shadows.</p>
<p>But before you pick your lighting options, find out what color your product is because of the fact that this greatly affects how everything works out. You can bounce cards from white foam, and even play with the reflections and shadows to create your desired effects.</p>
<p>The opportunities are endless.</p>
<p>But, wait.</p>
<p>How about if you want to use natural light coming in from the windows? You can do that too! The trick is to control the natural light coming in from the window; you don’t want it to be too one-sided to any degree. So, use bounce boards if necessary.</p>
<p>Quick advice?</p>
<p>Make sure you always have two sources of light. Well, if you don’t, a pair of bright bulbs – the cool 5000K kind will usually do the trick.</p>
<p>Remember, that lighting can be tricky and dependent on a number of factors that are not directly related to lightning per se. For example, the aperture of the camera plays a vital role in how much exposure your product photograph gets in general.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about white balance and ISO filters, these play such a crucial role in the exposure of your photograph.</p>
<p>More importantly, don&#8217;t be afraid of shadows. In a perfect environment, you would want to eliminate them altogether, but it can also be a creative way to “frame” your photo.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Background</strong></h2>
<p>Product photographs usually utilize white backgrounds. Again, as we’ve repeated time and time again, if you have the money and are going to do this often, it’s better to invest in something great.</p>
<p>White sweeps can be bought online, or if you’re on a tight budget, you can always use poster board or cardboard, and sometimes even a sheet.</p>
<p>But, here’s the caveat:</p>
<p>Remember that the color that you see now has a chance to look different in photographs. This is especially the case with poster boards.</p>
<p>Off-white as opposed to pure white really looks different when you start “framing” your product.</p>
<p>What kind of sweep should you get? It really depends on you. Paper sweep is a good choice because it’s cost effective since you can always get rid of the dirty areas. Also, make sure that the white background is seamless.</p>
<h2><strong>The Extras</strong></h2>
<p>There are a few other things that you will need in order to set up the product photo shoot. Make sure you have a table in order for you to have a place to put the products on.</p>
<p>Make sure you have some tape ready to get everything in order and have someone around to help you out, should the need arise.</p>
<h2><strong>The Checklist: How to Take Product Photos</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14239" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-5.jpg" alt="camera equipment" width="1920" height="1361" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-5.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-300x213.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-768x544.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-650x461.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Get your table in order; this means getting your product in place and making sure you’ve got everything you need.</li>
<li>Set your camera with the product in focus.</li>
<li>Double check the background, is there anything that will mess up the photo to begin with? Everything in the background has to be clean.</li>
<li>Get your light right. It helps if you have a hand with the bounce cards at this point.</li>
<li>Using the tips that we gave you adjust your camera as necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>and here&#8217;s more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the shutter</li>
<li>It’s probably going to be a bad photo.</li>
<li>So, readjust and hit that button again, and take as many photos as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations, you now have a product photo! And now, let&#8217;s move onto touching up.</p>
<h2><strong>Touching Up</strong></h2>
<p>There are plenty of post-processing programs that you can use like Adobe Lightroom (or VSCOCam if you did plan on post-processing on your phone). They offer you many benefits; they can alter lighting and change the mood with a flick of the switch.</p>
<p>Always look for ways to enhance your photo with minimal effort. You don’t want to end up with something that looks completely natural. If you nailed down most of the steps above, then you shouldn’t even be spending too much time with post-processing.</p>
<p>Want a better way to do this?</p>
<p>Get your photos touched up by a professional.</p>
<p>You would be surprised at how affordable it’ll be to just send the photos to a professional.</p>
<p>Some would even only charge you roughly $4 per photograph that you submit for a professional touch up.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The bottom line is that you won’t be able to get everything down on your first “click”, but that’s all part of the process. Give it just a little time.</p>
<p>You can hire professionals to take the photographs for you, but that will cost you time and money.</p>
<p>However, if you decide to take that route, I hope that this article will give you the basics of painting the theme that you want them to capture.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it takes a lot of photos and preparation to even score one perfect photograph to be used commercially. Let your enthusiasm and creativity get the best of you.</p>
<p>Product photography lighting is a crucial skill to learn and you can always apply it to future products that you release.</p>
<p>It certainly is a win-win situation.</p>

<p class="p1">Consumers seek time-saving shortcuts all the time, and their attention naturally gravitates to the quickest way to gather information: images.</p>
<p class="p1">Product images not only testify to the quality of your product, but also serve as windowfs into your ecommerce store, creating 2 very important things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Transparency</li>
<li class="p1">Trust</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">When consumers view a product page, they are looking for proof of quality and value.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Images shape their first impression, creating a tipping point as to whether they will continue browsing and eventually make a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Here, we’ll show you how to take images that:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Engage</li>
<li class="p1">Convert</li>
<li class="p1">Boost the lifetime value of your customers.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">We’ll also go over how to optimize the photo creation process to save you time and money.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that you don’t need a large budget to create polished and professional product photos.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>In fact, we will show you how to do it for about $50.</strong></p>
<h2 class="p3">What is Product Photography?</h2>
<p class="p1">Product photography uses specific techniques to showcases products in an attractive way and entice potential buyers to purchase specific products.</p>
<p class="p1">Product photography is an essential part of both online and offline advertising for successful catalogues, brochures, magazine ads, billboards, online ads and company websites, specifically when selling products direct to consumer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26871 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-22.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="387" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-22.jpg 581w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ecommerce-product-photography-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s take a closer look at why images are so important.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why Photography Increases Conversions</h2>
<p class="p1">90% of information transmitted to our brain is visual.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">No matter how sophisticated, website visitors are first engaged by visual elements, not written copy.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Photos are a key part of a consumer&#8217;s decision-making process, ultimately determining conversion and retention rates.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The quality of a product photo reflects your brand image, creating the infamous first impression.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The key to making the most of their first impress is to present polished, professional images that evokes maximum engagement.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Quality visuals enhance every buyer touchpoint.<span class="s1"><br /> </span></h3>
<p class="p1">93% of consumers consider images essential in purchasing decisions.</p>
<p class="p1">Your images represent your product’s perceived value and quality. They speak directly to your target audience, making your product page and content more relatable.</p>
<p class="p1">Take Naturally Curly’s for example.</p>
<p class="p1">They offer amazing images of simple, everyday products, often making them cool and appealing.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at the product images below. How neat and trustworthy do they look?</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26864 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-23.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="319" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-23.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-1-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p class="p1">Again, you don’t need a large budget to create polished and professional product photos. In this guide, we’ll show you how to do it for $50.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Images are a key element of branding.</h3>
<p class="p1">Branding should be central to every decision your company makes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your social media posts</li>
<li class="p1">Website updates</li>
<li class="p1">All your marketing efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">And images are at the helm of your brand. They are the first to grab attention, instill trust, and invite customers to take a further look.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Everything in an image<span class="s2">—</span>quality, subject matter, color theme and saturation<span class="s2">—</span>should speak in a uniform voice that resonates with your target audience.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Your goal is to form long-term relationships with your customers, and photos are one of the most important tools to achieve that.</p>
<p class="p1">Seriously Silly Socks does a great job at this. They offer polished but super brand-charged product-only images.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26863 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-24.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="300" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-24.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-2-300x120.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Seriously Silly Socks</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">The 2 Types of Ecommerce Product Photography</h2>
<p class="p1">There are two main types of images that should be used on your product page and across your marketing channels.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><strong>The first are clean-cut, white background, product-only images.</strong> These should include your featured product, and a variety of images showcasing your product from different angles. Below is an example of Sierra Designs’ product-only shot.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-26862 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-25.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="325" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-25.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-3-300x130.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The second is in-context or lifestyle photos</strong> that show your product being used in its intended environment or alongside complementing products.<em> </em>Here’s the same product in a lifestyle or in-context shot.<em><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26865 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-26.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="391" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-26.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-4-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-4-1-1596x834.jpg 1596w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-4-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></em></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4">Product-Only Images.</h3>
<p class="p1">Product-only images are meant to show your product in its best light from all relevant angles.</p>
<p class="p1">They are usually shot on a white background, helping to create a consistent look across your product line.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">These images describe your product at a glance and are best suited for your product page. Their job is to nurture page visitors towards making a purchase.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Contrary to what people might assume, you actually need about a dozen images on your product page, not just one or two.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of them should be product-only shots, with one or two in-context shots mixed in, designed to create further emotional bonds with your product.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Product-only images are generally the most suited for product pages, as they have a significantly higher rate of conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="p4">In-Context Images.</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26860 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-27.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="327" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-27.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-5-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Dainty Jewells</em></p>
<p class="p1">Lifestyle shots, ones that tell a story, are best suited for social media, blog posts, emails, and other marketing channels at the top of your conversion funnel.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It’s also good to add a few in-context snaps to your product page, helping to to boost emotional engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">The same rules apply to taking lifestyle photos as in product-only shots, apart from the fact that lifestyle photos allow you a lot more creative freedom.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use a camera, with or without a tripod, or why not take your products photos outdoors, to a settings that suits your brand’s voice.</p>
<p class="p1">For outdoor shoots on a budget, it is best to use natural light.</p>
<p class="p1">You can achieve really beautiful results if you shoot early in the morning or in the late afternoon, when the light is filtered at a smaller angle.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Basic Product Photography Equipment and Process</h2>
<p class="p1">For those new to photography, your first product shoot may seem overwhelming.</p>
<p class="p1">But after a few rounds, each step will become more natural, and you won’t even have to think about it.</p>
<p class="p1">The key is to find a process that suits your needs, optimize it, and create a set of guidelines to ensure you keep your images consistent.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at our DIY product photography tips.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Set up your background and product.<span class="s1"><br /> </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Getting the right background is worth the effort, because it simplifies the entire editing process.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Use a white or light backdrop, as it’s easy to remove when retouching your images.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">There are lots of ways you can improvise a background on a budget, and we will look at two that can be set up for under $20.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">A shooting table: You can create this with a chair you have in your home or office.</li>
<li class="p1">A light tent</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p6">Shooting Table.</h4>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26859 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-28.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-28.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-6-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">The first is a chair mounted sweep. For this, all you need is a roll of craft paper.</p>
<p class="p1">The simplest way to achieve this is by pushing a chair against a wall, and taping craft paper on the wall allowing it naturally fall to the ground, creating a seamless transition between the vertical to horizontal plane.</p>
<p class="p1">Or you can clip the paper to the top of the chair to improvise a stand for your sweep like the image above.</p>
<h4 class="p6">Light Tent.</h4>
<p class="p1">The other budget approach is to create your own lightbox, aka light tent.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">A light tent is a box-shaped device with translucent walls, designed to help distribute the light evenly around the object of photography.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Here’s how to set one up.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">To get started, you need a plastic storage container that you can put on its side with the lid off.</li>
<li class="p1">Then, tape some white paper to the bottom, and you can also tape white paper or cloth on the sides to serve as diffusers, which helps to distribute the light better, minimizing unnecessary shadows.</li>
<li class="p1">Depending on your budget, you can use artificial lighting and place them either side of the container, or for those on a budget take advantage of natural lighting by placing it your DIY lightbox next to a large window.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p6">Setting up your Product.</h4>
<p class="p1">It’s important to make sure you set your product up in front of your background on a flat, stable surface.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you get the lighting right, you’re almost ready to shoot.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re shooting jewelry, it’s always best to use a bust. Those on a budget can improvise by making one from a piece of cardboard, like in the image below.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26858 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-29.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-29.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-7-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">You can also use fishing line to suspend earrings and other small items, which is easily removed in the editing process.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas for harder to photograph items:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Use glue dots and tape to fix small items in place.</li>
<li class="p1">For clothing, it’s always best to use a mannequin, which can be easily removed.</li>
<li class="p1">You could try experimenting with a hanger or even creative flatlay.</li>
<li class="p1">For lifestyle shots, why not ask a friend or team member to sport your clothes for some bonus photos.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">If you are shooting large items, like furniture, you will need a stand mounted sweep that might cost a little more.</p>
<p class="p1">But you can improvise by getting a few rolls of craft paper, taping them to the wall, and letting gravity do all the work.</p>
<p class="p1">This technique follows the same principles as the table mounted sweep, only it’s a bit bigger.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Get your lighting right.</h3>
<p class="p1">If there is one deciding factor that defines the quality of your images, it’s light.</p>
<p class="p1">Lighting can be very tedious to set up, but when done right, it brings beautiful results and significantly simplifies your post-processing.</p>
<p class="p1">You have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Natural Light:</strong> Best if you’ve created a chair mounted sweep.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Studio Light:</strong> Best if you have the budget, or if you create a lightbox.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p6">Natural Light.</h4>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26856 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-31.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-31.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-9-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-9.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p class="p1">When you’re on a budget, you should use natural light. It’s much easier to manipulate, and, for small in-house product shoots, it can save you lots of time and hassle.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Start by placing your shooting table near a large window, ideally one that allows lots of light into the room.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If the light is too harsh, you can diffuse it by placing a cloth or white paper over the window (see image above).</p>
<p class="p1">If the shadows are too harsh, use white plasterboard or cardboard on either side of the object, helping to reflect some light and soften it. It’s always best to shoot when the day is at its brightest, giving you more light to play with.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26855 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-32.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-32.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-10-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">Better to have too much sunlight and minimise it, than not enough.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s very hard to create great lighting during the editing process.</p>
<p class="p1">But keep in mind never to shoot under direct sunlight. Just like a strong backlight, direct light can create harsh shadows.</p>
<h4 class="p6">Studio Lights.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26854 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-33.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="450" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-33.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-11-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: arqspin</em></p>
<p class="p1">If you have to use artificial lighting, you will need at least two softbox light setups to get the shadows right.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">You can typically buy two clip-on light clamps, with strong bulbs for under $30. If your budget is slightly higher, you can get two softbox setups for about $50.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">One of the lights should serve as your key light, and the other as your fill light or backlight, depending on your desired results.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider placing some white paper or cloth over them to diffuse some of the light, helping to achieve softer shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">Your key light should be placed in front <span class="s2">— </span>often slightly to the side <span class="s2">— </span>of the product, while your fill or backlight is on the opposite side, back or above.</p>
<p class="p1">Manipulate the angles and distance of the lights until you get soft, evenly distributed shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also use white plasterboard or cardboard to defuse some of the light and further soften those shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This is what lightboxes are designed to do; they are a diffuser of sorts, distributing the light evenly around the product.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">With that in mind, studio lights give you more control over the entire process, especially if you are shooting multiple products over several hours.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have the right setup, you can get consistent, professional results and recreate them for all your shoots.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Use a tripod.</h3>
<p class="p1">Tripods bring consistency, stability, and focus.</p>
<p class="p1">It is easy to end up with blurry images when you try to get your entire product in focus, while holding your camera in your hand without moving.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">If you can’t fit a tripod into your budget, use a pile of books or a stool to keep your camera fixed.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">A decent tripod will serve you well for many years, and you should be able to get one for under $30. It’s definitely worth picking on up when you have some budget.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re using a camera, set it to a low aperture (AKA a high f/stop), and slow shutter speed.</p>
<p class="p1">That way you will get a wide depth of field, keeping your entire product in focus, leaving your products looking crisp.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s vital to stabilize your camera when you are shooting with a wide depth of field in order to avoid blurry images.</p>
<h3 class="p4">4. Pick the right camera.</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26853 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-34.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="400" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-34.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-12-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">It is the most essential element to any product photography shoot: a camera.</p>
<p class="p1">Prices of DSLR and point and shoot cameras have steadily dropped over recent years.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">Recommended DSLR Settings for Product Photography:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use a wide angle lens. You will distort your product.</li>
<li>Use the right aperture for the right shot. A wide aperture like f2.8 or f4.5 will narrow your depth of field, leaving parts of your product out of focus. A small aperture like f8 or f11 will give you a wider depth of field, keeping your entire product crisp and in focus.</li>
<li>Use the correct white balance. When shooting, you should set it to the same Kelvin temperature as your lights.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">However, if you have a smartphone, you don’t need to worry about investing in a camera when you’re getting starting.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Smartphone camera technology has come a long way and sometimes you can take even better pictures than you might using a professional camera.</p>
<p class="p1">So as long as you get your lighting and background right, your iPhone or Samsung device can do a good job.</p>
<p class="p1">You might want to get a smartphone stabilizer or tripod, like Joby, at some point to help reduce blur and speed up post-processing.</p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Don’t forget post-processing.</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26852 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-35.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="447" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-35.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-13-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p class="p1">Retouching your images after the shoot is vital to achieving a polished look.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Even if you shoot your product with a smartphone, editing can be the difference between mediocre and professional results.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">For those starting out, getting the background or the lighting right takes a bit of trial and error. Thankfully photo editing can make a multitude of flaws magically disappear.</p>
<p class="p1">Retouching covers anything from background removal to color correction, mannequin removal, and shadow addition for a more natural look.</p>
<p class="p1">Photo editing is a time-consuming process, especially until you get the hang of things.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Luckily, there’s a world of free image editing tools available to help with all your photo editing needs.</p>

<h2 class="p3">How to Create Product Photography Guidelines</h2>
<p class="p1">Once you have the process down to a fine art, make sure you take the time to create clear shooting, brand, and editing guidelines so you can maintain consistency as your business grows.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This step won’t cost anything, apart from the time it takes you to write it down!</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Make sure you document all the minor things, including things like the distance between the camera and product, angles, and lighting setup.</p>
<p class="p1">Trust me, it’s worth the effort in the long run.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that your product photos are basically brand ambassadors, and maintaining consistency is crucial.</p>
<p class="p1">Create a technical guide and a template in your editing software that will help you maintain consistent size and scale.</p>
<p class="p1">Go a step further and create a style guide for your in-context snaps too.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure you include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Color Palette</li>
<li class="p1">Saturation</li>
<li class="p1">Focal Length</li>
<li class="p1">Shadows</li>
<li class="p1">Composition</li>
<li class="p1">Location and Context</li>
<li class="p1">Consistency</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Share your guide with everyone involved in your product shoots, and post a copy in your in-house studio for quick reference.</p>
<p class="p1">Having an image guide will not only save you money in the long run, but also save you lots of time as you won’t have to repeat the training processes.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you can focus on more profitable tasks, such as growing your business.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Optimizing Your Images (and Increasing SEO)</h2>

<p class="p1">Don’t forget to optimize your images so you get the best quality possible, while also making sure you don’t reduce page load speed.</p>
<p class="p1">Most platforms and marketplaces have their own set of photo editing requirements, so make sure you find out what yours are.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">When it comes to your product page, every second counts and can hurt your conversion rate.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Make sure you implement free minifying tools to optimize your images, and shave off a few unnecessary kilobytes.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, always make sure you name your images correctly, including as much relevant metadata and keywords as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">This additional detail helps search engines understand what is in the image, helping to improve your ranking giving you boost in organic traffic.</p>
<div class="post-detail__crosslink post-detail__style-light">
<p class="h3">More traffic = more customers = more money.</p>
</p>
<p>Google just announced that beginning summer of 2018, mobile page load speed will be a ranking factor for mobile search results.</p>
<p>That means that your site needs to load fast – officially – or no one will be able to find it.</p>
<p>To account for this, <span class="s1">BigCommerce has integrated Akamai Image Manager into the Stencil theme platform. This integration delivers lighter, faster images at the highest visual quality by optimizing each online image for device type, image quality and download size. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Improvements to customer engagement from faster loading images has been shown to improve conversion by up to 19% and cut image prep time by 25% in Akamai’s studies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our own BigCommerce study has found enabling Image Manager can improve page load speed by up to 70% in a closed beta in Q3 2017.</span></p>
<p>Test a Stencil theme now to see the difference.</p></div>
<h2 class="p3">All The Tools You Need to Get It Done (&lt;$50)</h2>
<p class="p1">The world of ecommerce is showing no sign of slowing down, and your product photos provide prospective customers a virtual window into your business.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s no doubt about it, visual content plays a huge part in online purchasing decisions.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Consumers are constantly being bombarded with information online, and have to make immediate decisions based on the content you choose to offer them.</p>

<li class="p1">Create a seamless white background with some white poster board taped to the bottom of a large clear plastic storage container that’s flipped onto its side.</li>
<li class="p1">To make a product float, use thread from a standard sewing kit to elevate the product and then erase the thread in post processing.</li>
<li class="p1">For reflection, place a small piece of plexiglass under the product.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p1">Should I invest in professional product photography?</h3>
<p class="p2">If you can afford it, yes.</p>
<p class="p2">Photos of your product both by themselves and in use are some of the most important merchandising and marketing efforts you do for your online brand.</p>
<p class="p2">Because consumers cannot touch or see your product in person, your product photography must do the trick.</p>
<p class="p2">If you can, hire a professional. If you can’t, this guide will walk you through how to bootstrap it for the time being.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How much does a product photographer cost?</h3>
<p class="p2">Product photography rates range from $7 a photo to $50 for setup and $25/hour – or more.</p>
<p class="p2">You’ll need to work with various photographers to get the pricing model right for your needs and your type of products.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p2">For instance, if you have a large catalog –– $7 per photo probably isn’t reasonable and you’d be better off with an hourly range. If you only have a few products, you’re likely better off with an hourly rate.</p>

				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>Your business is <em>alive and kicking</em>.</p>
<p>Just like how your business has a life cycle, so do your customers. They are continuously interacting with the goods and services that you offer. This phenomenon is often referred to as the <em>customer lifecycle.</em></p>
<p>To put it into quick perspective, there are different ways to get a potential customer to consider your offering and then ensure that they’ll come back for more <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<p>Want to know the secret art? Read on.<br />
<span id="more-14268"></span></p>
<p>It might appear to be difficult when you come to know about it but it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll explain how it really works but before we proceed, you&#8217;ll need to be able to identify the different phases a customer goes through.</p>
<h2><strong>The Stages of The Customer Life Cycle</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing to understand before you can start luring customers is the intrinsic value of the customer lifecycle.</p>
<p>Life is synonymous with business; both have different stages.</p>
<p>Namely, this process is broken into these main steps: your reach, acquisition, development and nurturing, retaining them, and creating an advocacy.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t just about making them come back for more. For you to understand the technique, you need to look at those in context.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reach</strong> – this refers to how you can get your offerings in front of your customer. Think advertising, promotion, and outreach.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong> – getting them to pay for your good or service.</li>
<li><strong>Development and nurturing</strong> – maintaining the relationship with them. If you already got them to buy once, you can always get them to do it again.</li>
<li><strong>Retention</strong> – keeping your customers close, very close.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy</strong> – pretty much, getting to love you so much that they’ll spread the word.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are important in developing your customer relationship management (CRM) along with the customer lifecycle.</p>
<h2><strong>Increasing Customer Life Cycle Value</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we have it all hammered down, let’s take a look at how we can increase the customer lifecycle and turn clients into clientele.</p>
<p>The most important part of increasing customer lifecycle value is the relationship that you have with your customer after the sale. For most entrepreneurs, this is probably going to be the best part.</p>
<p>And, it gets better:</p>
<p>Getting this right usually results in more business for your enterprise. Take a step back and think about this for a little while. What’s better- a single sale over one period <em>or</em> repeat sales from a particular customer?</p>
<p>In theory, repeat sales cost less money to procure and open the doors to even more opportunities in the future. (I&#8217;ll discuss this later)</p>
<h2><strong>An Impeccable After Sales Experience</strong></h2>
<p>Ever loved an almost perfect service only for your feelings towards it to change after speaking to annoying tech support reps who only care about logging in their hours?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there.</p>
<p>You may have the perfect product and service but, if your after sales experience sucks, they’re not going to come back for more.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have proper procedures in place to handle the after sales aspect of the actual sale. This includes having a good team that can handle any concerns, having a proper feedback system, and <em>follow up.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just follow up if they have a complaint. If they do have a complaint, you should get very personal with them in your connection. Check out Pizza Hut&#8217;s example: an apology letter sent to this woman.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14277" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers.png" alt="Pizaa hut customer relations" width="922" height="540" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers.png 922w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-4.08.28-PM-300x176.png 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-4.08.28-PM-768x450.png 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-4.08.28-PM-650x381.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /></p>
<p>You might be thinking of follow up as a way to generate sales off the bat, but trust me, customers usually know when you’re attempting an upsell almost immediately after the sale.</p>
<p>Instead of offering them an add-on, ask them how they feel about a product and how you can help them with your offering. Every interaction with them has to show that you care about them more than your profits.</p>
<p>Believe me, it’s not that hard to implement and certainly begs the question &#8211; &#8216;How to do it?&#8217;</p>
<p>Well, here are some very useful ways.</p>
<h3><strong>Offer More Than What They’ve Asked For</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that it takes more than five times the resources to make a new sale than retain a new one? So if you’re already spending money then you should offer more!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about giving away your stock, but rather about <em>adding value </em>to the value that they’re purchasing.</p>
<p>An extended warranty, semi-preferential treatment, special packaging, special rates, free shipping, no delivery charge, as long as it’s making them feel special, they’ll want to get that feeling from you.</p>
<p>Plus:</p>
<p>They’ll associate that particular feeling with your products allowing you to develop your brand even more.</p>
<p>Check out this Redditor who talks about how Dell values warranties on their products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14270" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-1.png" alt="Dell customer service" width="602" height="108" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-1.png 602w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-11.56.12-PM-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>After talking to their customer they decided to actually send a real person over and not even let the customer spend a single penny!</p>
<h3><strong>Bond With Your Customer</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right. One of the ways that you can positively increase the customer lifecycle is to bond with your customer. Create meaningful interactions if you can and create real avenues for conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media is a good tool. Use it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14273 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-2.png" alt="Redbull prolonging customer lifecycle" width="601" height="479" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-2.png 601w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-3.42.11-PM-300x239.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you just love this? Red Bull, one of the biggest beverage companies in the world with a roster of famous people that we love, freely interacts with their customers. Social media can easily bridge the divide if customers perceive you to be too corporate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide feedback on your end with regard to how others use the offerings that they have purchased.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14269" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-3.png" alt="Grammarly email" width="557" height="246" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-3.png 557w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-2.49.20-PM-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p>Check out how Grammarly&#8217;s emails aren&#8217;t really annoying and make for a very casual read. In fact, you feel great about using their services and they can even encourage you to write some more! (Whilst, indirectly telling you they&#8217;re helping you!)</p>
<p>They create this collaborative feeling between you and their company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send emails to them on special days with special offers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to them and ask them how they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>But:</p>
<p>Don’t be annoying.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand Your Customer</strong></h3>
<p>If you think you’ve nailed the three most important precepts of customer retention. Then, you’re ready for more.</p>
<p>Customers’ needs are very dynamic, as a result of this, you also have to be as dynamic with your offerings.</p>
<p>This goes beyond the usual surveys or customer feedback that we’re all used to. Study their purchasing behavior and see how you can improve your products to match demand. Find out what makes them tick and adapt to that, it will all be worth it in the long run.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Check out what Starbucks used to do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14275" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-4.png" alt="My Starbucks Idea" width="318" height="445" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-4.png 318w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-3.48.37-PM-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></p>
<p>Although they have now moved this to their main Twitter page, it still serves as a good example of a company reaching out to their customers and asking them to get involved!</p>
<h2><strong>Tools to Help You Nurture Lifecycle</strong></h2>
<p>If you own a company then you should pay attention to your customer relationship management.</p>
<p>There are probably a hundred different CRM software choices available for you out there and you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems picking one out of the pack.</p>
<p>Pick one that allows you to funnel your customers in their different stages of the lifecycle.</p>
<p>However, realize one thing, most CRM software solutions are concentrated on sealing the deal. Look for one that helps you keep a connection going with your customer even after the initial sale.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to nurture the relationship, not the sale itself.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Them to Stay Loyal</strong></h2>
<p>The customer life cycle is just like any relationship that you’ll have with a person. With that being said, it’s important to note that loyalty plays an important role in getting them to stay with you.</p>
<p>But, it’s not your customers that need to be loyal to your brand or offering. You have to make sure that you’re loyal to them as well.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to sound like your spouse, but loyalty is a two-way stream. As I&#8217;ve discussed earlier, you need to nurture the business relationship that you have with your customer.</p>
<p>Build an advocacy with your customers. Trust me, you&#8217;ll reap the benefits soon enough.</p>
<p>Customers will start talking about you and that&#8217;s when you realize that you&#8217;ve done a great job.</p>
<p>For instance, look at this random Buffer user. Check out the personalized reply from Buffer after the customer advocated their product.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14276" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-5.png" alt="Buffer Reply" width="625" height="557" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-5.png 625w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-3.55.07-PM-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>By the way, if you&#8217;re having a social management debacle with regard to nurturing the customer lifecycle, you can use their service. You see the effect? Even we like them for some reason!</p>
<p>They nail it perfectly. They offered a great service that made users advocate for them, they tend to be personal with their users and that establishes a connection, and they can be sure that this user will keep coming back.</p>
<p>This is the <em>bottom line</em>:</p>
<p>If you take care of them, they&#8217;ll take care of you, because they&#8217;re only human too.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this article has provided enough insight to help you develop and nurture the most important values of your customer lifecycle.</p>
<p>At the end, all you got to do is care about them as if they were family.</p>

<p class="p1">Whether you’re a developer, marketer, entrepreneur or Fortune 500 CEO, there’s an inkling in the back of your mind that perhaps, in the near future, <strong>your job or company may be obsolete.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s not an unfounded fear.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">The rules to success for nearly all industries in today’s economy are fleeting, at best.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Everything keeps changing, and the best of the best have to be able to pivot –– quickly and competently –– in order to keep up.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, to keep up with the newest skill sets and execute on the most modern of campaigns, you often need 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Money.</li>
<li class="p1">Headcount.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This need positions the biggest brands of the world well, enabling them to form monopolies, of sorts – in theory at least.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet, that isn’t what we’re seeing take shape.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Large organization move too slowly to pivot quick enough to execute well on trends.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Instead, those companies end up buying the brands that do (re: Walmart acquiring Jet.com and Unilever buying Dollar Shave Club).</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What enables those up-and-comers to take on their legacy competitors (i.e. Amazon and Gillette)?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Agile marketing that gets these brands to the forefront of customer conversion in a more compelling way than traditional companies.</p>
<p class="p1">This guide will walk you through what I believe to be the first step toward agile marketing for large enterprises.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what I’ll cover:</p>
<h3 class="p3">What’s in Our Ecommerce Replatforming Guide</h3>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Startups focus on marketing, because their technology is covered:</strong> Enterprise brands can do this, too. I explain how.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>There are 3 pain points that often forces brands to migrate to new technology – and all of them are signals that you should have done it much, much sooner.</strong> But I believe in staring at a problem. We’ll walk through how you can do it right now.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Your 3 options when it comes to ecommerce technology.</strong> Not every solution is right for every brand. But there are ones that will eliminate the need for you to migrate ever again –– and ones that will force this process time and time again. We’ll go through the cost/benefit analysis of these.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The 6 steps to an ecommerce re-platforming and migration.</strong> The biggest 2 of which are issuing the RFP and transferring the data. I’ll give you an RFP template you can print out and use right now –– and introduce you to the free services teams that will migrate your data for you. Yes, free. Seriously.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>A primer on what NOT to do during a shopping cart migration.</strong> Again, I don’t like to admire problems. I address them. This is the elephant in the room. The #1 rule? Don’t over invest. The point of your technology is to enable better and more effective marketing and sales. Whizzbang is nice, but not necessary.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>I’ll give you an ecommerce replatforming checklist.</strong> If you it this far in the piece, I’m assuming you, like me, like to get things done. This list will let you mark off one by one the steps you and your team need to take to do it first the first time, and then never again.  </li>
<li class="p1"><strong>I’ll teach you how to put platforms to the test.</strong> Sure, you issue an RFP and sure, you get answers back. But do not buy before you try. Do not buy before your developers try. Do not buy before your legal tries. DO NOT BUY BEFORE YOU TRY.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Another word on data migration services</strong> – because some platforms offer them for free, some services are self-serve and others are just plain worth the dollars to make sure your data transfers effectively. It is how you upset. It is how you better target marketing. It is how you know how your business is running up and to the right and not vice versa. It matters, so it gets its own section.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Finally, I’ll debunk the most common data migration myths out there.</strong> Just for fun.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Let’s get started.</p>
<div class="post-detail__crosslink post-detail__style-light">
<p class="h3">Ready to begin the RFP process?</p>
</p>
<p class="p1">Issuing an RFP is the next step for brands considering a re-platform. However, RFPs can be tricky – and what you include in them makes a world of difference in terms of what you get from your new platform (and also in making the right choice to begin with).</p>
<p>This free RFP includes 188 questions, from big ideas to minutiae, so you don&#8217;t miss a thing. </p>
<p>Download your free RFP template.</p></div>
<h2 class="p4">Successful Brands Focus on Marketing</h2>
<p class="p1">What allows these companies to focus on marketing is their choice of technology stack from the onset.</p>
<p class="p1">Or, if not from the onset, these companies are quick to replatform to a better solution, so that website maintenance and bug patches are not taking priority over marketing activities.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">The latter leads to sales, growth and revenue.</li>
<li class="p1">The former doesn’t have to be business as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">That is why you must pick the right ecommerce platform – because you need to focus on marketing and growth.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, marketing is expensive, competitive, and requires a lot of time.</p>
<p class="p1">It is pay-to-play in so many channels:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Adwords.</li>
<li class="p1">Facebook.</li>
<li class="p1">TV.</li>
<li class="p1">Radio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In the ones where it isn’t – say, SEO – you’re competing against a gamut of competitors and bigger brands, often with a much bigger head start.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">And, each of these channels are getting more and more saturated everyday. So why are you spending your time and money on a “good enough” ecommerce solution?</p>
<p class="p1">

<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<p class="h3">SUCCESSFUL ECOMMERCE REPLATFORMING EXAMPLES</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">The Carolina Panthers: Making the switch from Yahoo to BigCommerce meant a 16% decrease in site bounce rate, 83% increase in mobile conversion rate and a 37% increase in conversion across the board. And that was just after launching.</li>
<li class="p1">Henna Caravan: Making the switch from Magento to BigCommerce gave Henna Caravan a 33% increase in revenue through SEO and a 2X industry average conversion rate, all within 2 weeks of launch.</li>
<li class="p1">Veppo: Making the switch from Shopify Plus to BigCommerce saved Veppo thousands in revenue and reduced manual work hours by 40%.</li>
<li class="p1">Awesome GTI: Making the switch from Magento to BigCommerce increased Awesome GTI’s YoY revenue more than 95%, saw conversion rates increase nearly 15% and nearly a 17% increase in AOV YoY.</li>
<li class="p1">NaturallyCurly: Making the switch from Lemonstand to BigCommerce gave NaturallyCurly the ability to sync their ERP and storefront, saving the company 520 hours of manual work a week.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"></div>
</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Modern ecommerce platforms are the equivalent of a marketing technology, development and IT staff – all in one.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s Moore’s law.</p>
<p class="p1">Likely when you first launched your brand, ecommerce platforms were cumbersome, expensive and required hours of extra work you ended up taking on internally or that you’ve outsourced to platform experts.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, there are ecommerce platforms out there that take all the technical heavy lifting off your hands –– allowing your team and business the time and financial resources needed to capitalize on the market with strategic and engaging campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">This is how you win.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">You set yourself up for success.</li>
<li class="p1">You think about the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Would you still be using a Nokia brick phone today?</p>
<p class="p1">No. The Capt’n Crunch-size chip used in there is now the size of your fingernail –– and it stores a whole lot more.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Upward mobility requires change. Future-proofing is how you blockade against antiquation or even worse, extinction.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">The line is drawn in the sand. It’s time you choose your side.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Do 1 or More of These Issues Apply to You?</h2>
<p class="p1">In a perfect world, a site replatforming project would be a year in planning. You would have allotted budget and defined clear goals.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In reality, replatforming isn’t something companies proactively plan. Most often, there’s some driving issue — or a number of them — forcing a company to migrate.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Our team sees these issues regularly – and have compiled a string list of the most common below.</p>
<p class="p1">Go ahead, check off right next to the ones that apply to your business. Check off more than one, and it’s time to replatform.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Financial Issues Related to Your Ecommerce Platform</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We can’t afford to continue doing business with our existing ecommerce platform due to the high maintenance costs.</li>
<li class="p1">We experienced a recent merger or acquisition, allowing for consolidation and review of current platforms for efficiency gains.</li>
<li class="p1">We’re working on new initiatives such as launching new brands, product lines or launching into new markets. With new launches, we want to test out more cost-effective solutions in order to prove out concept. We’ve begun to see that the more cost-effective platforms outperform our legacy platform the main brand is using.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3">Technical Issues Related to Your Ecommerce Platform</h3>

<li class="p1">The catalogue database can’t handle the physical number of SKUs we’ve added to the catalogue over the years.</li>
<li class="p1">The platform only captures a limited number of attributes, can only associate a limited number of product related assets, has a limited call volume on APIs or, as in some cases, can’t handle certain types of content such as video.</li>
<li class="p1">It takes too long to develop new features on the old platform and the backlog of projects in IT is becoming unmanageable and cost prohibitive.</li>

<h3 class="p3">Marketing Issues Related to Your Ecommerce Platform</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">In our organization, our marketing team is the tip of the spear for online growth. Our marketing team is tasked with not only reaching potential customers and driving traffic to the site, but also converting at the highest rate possible. We want something more intuitive, allowing us to be more creative and quick in our GTM execution.</li>
<li class="p1">Our old ecommerce platform prevents our marketing team from converting visitors that otherwise might have converted on a newer, more featured platform. Worse still, our old platform prevents us from competing in key areas entirely. Some of the key features and capabilities that our marketing team is looking for include
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Improved Site Search:</strong> Directed and faceted. Marketing wants to be able to control search results for the best possible user experience.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Personalization:</strong> Dynamic content presentation and optimization based on multiple visitor personas.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Mobile Commerce:</strong> Specific design and funnel for mobile devices in the wake of mobile-first customer expectations.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Social Media:</strong> Hooks for marketing on the top social sites, easy share-ability and social commerce capabilities.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tag Management:</strong> Re-tagging the site for efficient digital marketing, increased search functionality and better SEO based on Google’s indexing of the site map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Any one of these requirements could be justification enough for a new platform.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Most companies looking to re-platform, however, have multiple of these issues.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Take mobile commerce, for example.</p>
<p class="p1">Mobile revenue has jumped dramatically with the combination of social media platforms and powerful mobile devices, over 50% for many retailers.</p>
<p class="p1">Not having your ecommerce website support mobile visitors cuts out a large selling opportunity, not to mention the SEO hit you take from Google’s newest search algorithms, which reward mobile readiness and penalize sites that don’t support mobile.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>In fact, beginning July 2018, Google will make mobile site speed also a ranking factor for mobile algorithms.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">This means your not only need to have a mobile-friendly site, but that it needs to be fast. Really fast.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Not having this one feature (which is really 2: mobile-friendly site and mobile page load speed), which takes months of coding for an on-premise or custom solution, is reason enough to switch — not to mention the financials of having to pay for such coding work.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">And that’s just a basic example. What about integration with new payment solutions like digital wallets?</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do you want to have to build out your individual brand integration with Amazon Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal One Touch, etc?</li>
<li class="p1">Or would you rather your platform build that out, test it and ensure it works, take on the PCI compliance and ultimately just have you be able to click, one and done it’s live on the product?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It’s your choice.</p>
<h2 class="p4">The Best Ecommerce Platform Options</h2>
<p class="p1">Before I begin to outline the process for a replatform, it’s important that you understand your ecommerce platform options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Homegrown.</li>
<li class="p1">Onsite or on premise.</li>
<li class="p1">Cloud.</li>
<li class="p1">SaaS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Below is an outline of each, including pros and cons based on your particular business needs.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the basic background information you’ll need for issuing a complete and structured ecommerce RFP to a technology provider, the details of which I’ll get into in a moment.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Homegrown Technology</h3>
<p class="p1">This is usually a custom LAMP or .NET-based implementation supplemented by various middleware, the origins of which you may or may not know.</p>
<p class="p1">Quite often, these platforms are also connected to backend systems running custom-built ERP software.</p>
<p class="p1">In my experience, I’ve even run across the occasional IBM AS400 mainframe locked away in the deep recesses of IT.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This middleware could easily be replaced by your smartphone today, but nobody dare touch it lest it breaks and brings the whole site down.</p>

<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">Homegrown Ecommerce Pros and Cons:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Pros: The pros of a homegrown platform are that you have the potential for ultimate flexibility. You can customize each feature exactly the way you want, without the constraint of a template. Although in reality, real world resource constraints can mean that potential flexibility isn’t realized.</li>
<li>Cons: The cons with a homegrown platform are that you are a customer of one and every feature you want to add has to be developed from the ground up. Homegrown platforms are also often expensive to maintain on a day-to-day basis.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p class="p1"><em>“We knew it was going to take us 5 years to get caught up with everyone else if we went with open source or custom build.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>We needed a platform that had everything we needed right then already built-in, and one with extensible APIs we could connect to our home grown ERP system.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>That meant we were looking at a SaaS solution.”</em></p>

<p>Read the Dazadi Story.</p></div>
<h3 class="p3">Onsite or On Premise Technology</h3>
<p class="p1">With onsite, sometimes called on premise technology, the ecommerce platform is licensed from and then hosted on the client’s internal network.</p>
<p class="p1">The client, or business owner, is then responsible for managing all ecommerce aspects including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Uptime</li>
<li class="p1">Bandwidth</li>
<li class="p1">CDN</li>
<li class="p1">PCI compliance and security.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Commonly deployed onsite platforms include Websphere, Oracle Commerce and Magento Enterprise.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">On Premise Ecommerce Pros and Cons:</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> The pros of this option are less obvious. There’s a perception of improved security, but I’ll let the security experts weigh in. “As online shopping continues to overpower in-store shopping, ecommerce sites are increasingly targeted by hackers as they have become a gold mine for credit card information,” said Shahar Tal, Malware and Vulnerability Research Manager at Check Point Software Technologies. “The vulnerability we uncovered [on Magento] represents a significant threat not to just one store, but to all of the retail brands that use the Magento platform for their online stores – which represents about 30% of the ecommerce market.”<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17032 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration-1.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="358" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/replatforming-forrester-SaaS-on-premise.jpg 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/replatforming-forrester-SaaS-on-premise-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> The cons of onsite deployments are that you need a small army of IT staff to run, maintain and sometimes update the platform. Also, quite often, companies customize their deployments to the point that they get off of the platform upgrade path and are then stuck on an old version of the ecommerce platform. The cost of these upgrades and maintenance, however, is likely the biggest con. A scaling ecommerce business can spend anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 per year to ensure an onsite solution is functioning properly. Here’s a calculator you can use to see what your overall costs would be if you were to migrate to or stay on an on premise solution.</li>

<p class="h3">Less Headaches. More Sales.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>“When I first bought Spectrum Audio, it was on Magento and I was literally paying developers every couple of days to fix something.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Our overhead on Magento was more than $2,000 a month alone, just between server costs and paying developers. And the sales weren&#8217;t near where they are today.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>To be a successful store owner, I can&#8217;t afford to have this huge team of developers that know everything. You can have someone on the inside for small fixes, but really we can&#8217;t be an ecommerce platform on top of being an online store.”</em></p>

<h3 class="p3">Cloud Ecommerce Technology</h3>
<p class="p1">There’s currently a lot of confusion in market about the difference between cloud ecommerce and SaaS ecommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s put that confusion to rest right now.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">SaaS and Cloud ecommerce are not the same.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">With Cloud ecommerce, you still pay extra in licensing fees, as well as to patch vulnerabilities and to complete upgrades.</p>
<p class="p1">This aspect of cloud ecommerce is similar to on-premise.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In fact, many on-premise ecommerce technologies are those that are launching cloud solutions.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">The difference, however, is that the server is hosted and maintained by a third-party, similar to how it is done in the SaaS model.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the differences between SaaS and cloud broken out.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">Differences Between Cloud Ecommerce and SaaS:</h6>

<li><strong>SaaS:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Cloud:</strong> No, there will be downtime during versioning updates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="p3">SaaS Ecommerce Technology</h3>
<p class="p1">Before we hop into this realm, know that there are multiple versions of SaaS ecommerce platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Multi-tenant:</strong> customers share the same instance of the application and receive upgrades simultaneously.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Single tenant:</strong> customers have their own instance of the application, upgrades are up to the customer</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hybrid models:</strong> customers share the same instance with simultaneous upgrades, with open APIs for custom iterations</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Multi-tenant architecture is one of the main reasons that SaaS ecommerce platforms have cost advantages over homegrown or onsite implementations.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Single tenant SaaS platforms take into account the need for specific brand customizability, but it’s easy to end up off the upgrade path and expose your brand to vulnerabilities (similar to on-premise technology).</p>
<p class="p1">A hybrid model is the best option for brands, allowing for low total cost of ownership, simultaneous platform upgrades and open APIs for extreme customizability without falling off an upgrade path.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In other words, business owners get the lower cost of the multi-tenant deployment with the custom capabilities of a single tenant deployment.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">An example of a hybrid ecommerce platform would be BigCommerce, where you can have a customized version of the platform but still benefit from the SaaS implementation.</p>
<p class="p1">The main aspect all SaaS deployments have in common is their pricing model. Business owners enter into a monthly payment agreement.</p>
<p class="p1">Some portions of the first year’s fees are usually due up front, but not always.</p>
<p class="p1">Pricing terms vary widely depending on the client’s circumstances, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Number of SKUs</li>
<li class="p1">Monthly sales</li>
<li class="p1">Monthly traffic and more.</li>
</ul>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">SaaS Ecommerce Pros and Cons:</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> The pros of implementing a SaaS platform are primarily based on cost and ease of management. With SaaS, the vendor is developing features for multiple customers and so the expense is amortized across the entire customer base, which keeps costs down for everyone. The SaaS vendor’s roadmap is also usually driven by demand from their customers, so you’re pooling requirements across multiple segments of the industry. This leads to a robust product feature roadmap, which meets and often exceeds the requirements of most clients.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> The cons of a SaaS deployment are that you are restricted to some degree by the nature of the fact that the platform is usually multi-tenant. This means that the flexibility you might have with a homegrown or on premise platform is not necessarily there. Many SaaS providers, however, have open APIs, which allow for third-party integrators that often function similarly to if you were integrating the software on your owned and operated system. As the SaaS ecommerce industry evolves, this con is much less of concern thanks to open and malleable APIs. In fact, BigCommerce allows for 100’s of API calls per second, letting retailers sync 25,000 product inventory from an ERP in only 60 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p1">OK, now that you know you need to switch and you know what your options are, it’s time to issue an RFP.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Your Ecommerce Replatform Strategy</h2>
<p class="p1">Do you know the #1 reason why brands migrate from their ecommerce platform?</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not just about money – but that is a big consideration.</p>
<p class="p1">It isn’t just about being able to execute cooler, more impactful marketing campaigns – but of course everything that exists on a RFP is getting at the end goal.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>No, the #1 reason is empowerment.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce marketing is harder than ever before. It’s also more costly. Brands can’t afford to move slowly. They can’t afford to NOT be agile.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">And yet, the vast majority of ecommerce platforms tie your marketing team’s hands behind their back – leaving them bobbing for conversion apples they could on other platforms simply just pick up.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">OK, that might not be the best metaphor. So, let’s dive in to the real work: issuing an RFP.</p>
<p class="p1">This will allow you switch from one ecommerce platform to another – all without losing your SEO rankings or customized design or legally required security protocol.</p>
<h3 class="p3">1. Get ready to issue an RFP (request for proposal).</h3>
<p class="p1">A proper Request for Proposal (RFP) process will help dramatically reduce your frustrations or concerns as you determine which SaaS provider is right for your growing business.</p>
<p class="p1">RFPs are used by scaling and enterprise brands looking to properly evaluate key stakeholder needs, scope and goals in large-scale projects which will affect the operation of an entire organization.</p>
<p class="p1">The more information you provide in the RFP process, the less room there is for confusion later on.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">A sloppy RFP could cost you months in wasted time, so be detailed, clear and over communicate your needs. This post will provide everything you need to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<div class="post-detail__crosslink post-detail__style-light">
<p class="h3">SHOULD I ISSUE AN RFP?</p>
</p>
<p class="p1">For ecommerce platforms, you should issue an RFP. This because of the various attributes unique to online businesses that must be accounted for.</p>
<p class="p1">Each ecommerce platform handles these needs a bit differently. You want to see their proposal, along with a quote, not just a quote for typical services.</p>
<p class="p1">RFPs generally require more work on both parties –– and this guide will explain your part, as the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get your free RFP template.</p></div>
<h3 class="p3">2. Write the RFP.</h3>
<p class="p1">Before you start committing the rest of the organization to an ecommerce replatforming project, you should conduct an initial ROI modeling session and begin internally mapping out the RFP process.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the first step to writing a RFP.</p>
<p class="p1">Sit down with finance and do an honest review of the ecommerce business. Before you can begin developing a detailed set of requirements and an RFP, you will need to have the numbers for your business locked down.</p>
<p class="p1">These include the usual:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Unique Visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Gross Revenue</li>
<li class="p1">Average Order Value (AOV)</li>
<li class="p1">Conversion rates</li>
<li class="p1">Number of transactions</li>
<li class="p1">Number of units per transaction</li>
<li class="p1">Gross Margin</li>
<li class="p1">Net Margin</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you decide to go down the SaaS platform route, you will be sharing this information with the vendor so they can calculate anticipated usage and pricing.</p>
<h3 class="p3">3. Forecast revenue and total cost of ownership.</h3>
<p class="p1">Next, create a three year forecasted improvement on the above metrics if you were to deploy a new platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Allow six months post launch for site optimization. Don’t forecast any lift during those six months.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a sample walkthrough of how you might achieve this for your own business.</p>
<p class="p1">The numbers below are based on a last 90 day calculation. The forecast based on 57% overall ecommerce growth by 2018.</p>
<p class="p1">Conservative numbers are used here.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26814 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration-3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="895" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-3-Mo-Forecast-750x895.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-3-Mo-Forecast-300x358.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-3-Mo-Forecast.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Once you figure out your business forecast, look into how much each ecommerce technology solution will cost.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use our Total Cost of Ownership Calculator here, or take a look at the sample chart below for reference, based on a business making at least $2,500,000 in revenue annually.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26815 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration.png" alt="" width="750" height="1004" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/saas-versus-magento-calculator-750x1004.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/saas-versus-magento-calculator-300x401.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Then, calculate your savings, and figure out the average cost for services like SEO, social media and more.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, add in the revenue lift generally seen by these services, and the upside associated with it for your business’ revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, you can use our calculator to do this automatically for you, or take a look at our sample below.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26816 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration-1.png" alt="" width="750" height="428" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/extra-budget-from-magento-750x428.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/extra-budget-from-magento-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Through this analysis, you will have determined the amount of investment you can reasonably afford for your website replatforming project.</p>
<p class="p1">This will save you time later on and help you to avoid looking too far into platforms that you simply cannot afford.</p>
<div class="post-detail__crosslink post-detail__style-light">
<p class="h3">REMEMBER TO ACCOUNT FOR DATA MIGRATION</p>
</p>
<p class="p1">Many ecommerce platforms will pass you off to a partner for transferring your catalog and customer data (what many people refer to as &#8220;data migration&#8221;), adding anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 to your initial launch fee and 6 weeks to 6 months in go-to-market timing.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s a lot of money and time – and can significantly affect total cost of ownership.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce offers free transfer services with a 4 week GTM timeline when coming from non-custom solutions.</p>
<p class="p1">Ask the platforms you’re considering about their options and account for this in your ROI model.</p>
<p>Free data migration services.</p></div>
<h3 class="p3">4. Investigate built-in functionality vs. third-party apps and integrations.</h3>
<p class="p1">A technical replatforming project is an opportunity to change and improve your efficiencies in other areas of the business.</p>
<p class="p1">To make sure you get the most, then, out of the RFP process, take a look at all existing business processes and determine if there are better ways to achieve the same results.</p>
<p class="p1">I also suggest taking a look at the various third-party apps that you have undoubtedly accumulated through the years, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Automated order notifications</li>
<li class="p1">Product filtering and faceted search</li>
<li class="p1">Automatic sales tax calculated at checkout</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Many of these can be replaced with features that now come standard on modern ecommerce platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">Add the savings from these projected changes into your budget.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">For example, 68% of online carts are abandoned and SaaS platforms like BigCommerce now recover on average 15% of those.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Be sure to calculate that revenue in your model. Here is a calculator you can use to do so.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26817 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration-4.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="374" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Abandoned-Cart-Calculator--750x374.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Abandoned-Cart-Calculator--300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Abandoned-Cart-Calculator-.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Try to use a fact-based measurement criteria during this discovery process. I prefer projected savings, revenue or ROI.</p>
<p class="p1">This phase of the process can be contentious since you’re talking about eliminating tools, processes and potentially people.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">

<p class="h3">A note on steering committees</p>
</p>
<p class="p1">I know many people recommend setting up steering committees for this process, but they’re not for everyone and they can definitely slow the replatforming process down.</p>
<p class="p1">I prefer to have one decision maker leading the project from the client side and have them ensure that all stakeholder requirements are captured and ranked.</p>
<p class="p1">There will, of course, be the need for stakeholder reviews, but they’re different from establishing an actual committee, specifically in the area of final decision-making.</p>
<p class="p1">For the fastest and most effective GTM strategy, avoid committees and appoint a project head.</p>
<p class="p1"></div>
</p>
<h3 class="p3">5. Scope integration redirects and initiation.</h3>
<p class="p1">This is the stage of the replatforming process where you should spend significant time and effort mapping out every touch point between the ecommerce platform and all other systems at your company.</p>
<p class="p1">Create a list of each integration point and determine what will happen to that integration during replatforming.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It’s at this crucial stage that you determine what’s in scope for the project and what is not.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Also include a review of any catalog transfers that will be necessary and make sure to include them in the RFP, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Customer data files</li>
<li class="p1">Product catalogues</li>
<li class="p1">Assets or content such as product images</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Proper due diligence at this stage of the process will save time and money later on. Review everything 2 or 3 times to make sure that nothing has been left out.</p>
<h3 class="p3">6. Meet with all potential stakeholders.</h3>
<p class="p1">Confirm that all stakeholders have been given ample opportunity to share their requirements as well as all business processes that interface with the ecommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Stakeholders are usually from the following departments/disciplines.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26810 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration-5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="2677" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-Stakeholder_Checklist-750x2677.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-Stakeholder_Checklist-300x1071.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-Stakeholder_Checklist.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2 class="p4">What Not to Do in the Replatform Process</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">On a very large project I personally worked on, after numerous sessions with all necessary stakeholders, I asked one last time if we had covered every process, integration point and application that would interface with the new ecommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Everyone nodded in acknowledgement &#8230; until one voice at the back of the room asked if we had accounted for the two guys in Turkey.</p>
<p class="p1">I thought he was joking.</p>
<p class="p1">He explained that those two guys performed a critical database conversion on the global master product data file on a nightly basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">True story.</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t forget about the two guys in turkey!</p>
<p class="p1">But don’t go overboard, either.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve seen countless million – tens of millions of dollars actually – wasted on high priced consulting firms more concerned about billable hours than finding the absolute best solution for the client.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Don’t fall into the trap of over engineering your solution.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">I’ve also seen architecture scoped out on PowerPoint slides that look amazing but are entirely unrealistic in the real world, either because they would run too slow, cost too much or just not integrate properly.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a myth that you can take the “best in breed” products in various categories and try to make them all fit together.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s much better to get one good platform and use it to the fullest extent possible.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">I’d be lying if I said I’ve never seen a company scope out a behemoth of integrated apps only to spend tens of millions of dollars and never see it run properly.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">True story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Recently, a company I know of spent millions of dollars (high teens) to deploy a large, well known ecommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Problem is, that by the time they got done engineering their idea of nirvana, the ecommerce platform’s role was basically relegated to that of a shopping cart!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">A state of the art full-blown platform operating at maybe 20% of its potential.</li>
<li class="p1">Millions of dollars wasted</li>
<li class="p1">An unnecessarily complicated architecture that took way too long to implement</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">What they ended up with could have been replaced with at most, a $3 million alternative.</p>
<p class="p1">This was a CIO gone wild. And this isn’t an isolated case. I’ve seen it way too often.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p4">A Handy Ecommerce Replatforming Checklist</h2>
<p class="p1">There are numerous ecommerce platforms available today, everything from simple carts to enterprise grade platforms that include strong search, personalization and CMS capabilities.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">For our purposes, let’s say that there are about 30 different platforms to choose from. That’s far too many to engage in an RFP.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">You should be able to narrow down your RFP list to 5-8 vendors based on your:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Current online revenue</li>
<li class="p1">SKUs</li>
<li class="p1">Ratio of traffic vs. transactions</li>
<li class="p1">Average order value</li>
<li class="p1">Units per order</li>
<li class="p1">Any unique elements specific to your business such as hard goods vs. soft goods, continuity/subscription business or complex configuration capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">At JCH, we use a process called the Accelerated Vendor Selection Process (AVSP).</p>
<p class="p1">This process is based on our experience and knowledge of ecommerce platforms, and this helps us to narrow the focus of the RFP down to the key features that are most important to the client.</p>
<p class="p1">Our RFPs contain over 150 questions to confirm vendor capabilities and for use in vendor comparison charts.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This may seem like a lot, but let’s put it into context: a mid-tier SaaS platform contains over 280 features.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">That doesn’t include third party integrations, catalog transfer services, systems architecture or security compliance issues — all of which will need to be addressed in the RFP process.</p>

<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">Ecommerce Migration Checklist:</h6>
<ol>
<li>Determine the best platform options for your business.</li>
<li>Issue an RFP to those platforms.</li>
<li>Forecast revenue and total cost of ownership.</li>
<li>Investigate built-in functionality vs. third-party apps.</li>

<li>Redesign site, relaunch in beta and QA with stakeholders.</li>
<li>Relaunch site publicly, and redirect URLs.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 class="p4">How to Put Platforms to the Test</h2>
<p class="p1">Based on the responses to your RFP, you should now have a short list of 3-5 potential vendors.</p>
<p class="p1">The next step is to create a detailed set of use cases to be performed by the vendor, via webex for smaller opportunities and onsite for larger deployments.</p>
<p class="p1">There are a couple reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Stakeholders get to see what a day in the life of using the platform will be like for them.</strong> Their feedback is invaluable. They get to see the different ways various vendors have chosen to execute various tasks in the platform and can see which methodologies might suit their particular requirements better. Lastly, maybe most importantly, they feel a sense of ownership in the process and an appreciation for the final vendor selection.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The more important reason for these tests is to make the vendor demonstrate their capabilities live.</strong> It’s easy for a vendor to say that they support a feature, but when it comes time to demonstrate it, the finer details are revealed. For example, a vendor may say they support a certain feature but in reality it requires a separate customization to actually deploy it in the field.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The list of use cases that you develop will depend on the size of deployment, but for the larger ones, it is advisable to schedule about four hours.</p>
<p class="p1">Some scenarios take 10 minutes to run through, others can take 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It’s very important that each vendor be given the same list and allotted time to complete their scenarios.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This creates a level playing field upon which comparisons can be more easily made, especially for the stakeholders who are new to the process.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use this checklist and agenda for your teams and the platform you are testing. This covers the majority of common needs during a replatform.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26813 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration-7.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="2241" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-Basic-Use-Case-Template-750x2241.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-Basic-Use-Case-Template-300x896.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ecommerce-Replatforming-Basic-Use-Case-Template.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><em>Download a printable version here. </em></p>
<p class="p1">We also allow half an hour at the beginning of the meeting for a general company sales pitch presentation, and about 20 minutes at the end for closing remarks and a final pitch.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what our top level agenda looks like, simplified.</p>

<h2 class="p4">Don’t Forget About Data Migration Services</h2>
<p class="p1">Transferring your product, category and customer data is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of an ecommerce replatforming or replatforming applications, in general.</p>
<p class="p1">Accurate data is essential to running your business.</p>
<p class="p1">A poor transfer could result in:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Incorrect product mapping.</li>
<li class="p1">Incorrect product commendations.</li>
<li class="p1">Incorrect product options.</li>
<li class="p1">Incorrect product images.</li>
<li class="p1">Inaccurate customer data.</li>
<li class="p1">Poor syncing with ERP or POS (think Square or Netsuite).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">And those are only to name a few.</p>
<p class="p1">You’d be stuck going through each individual SKU and updating all information for product data that was transferred or migrated incorrectly.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">For customer data, it would just be lost forever. I cannot stress enough how big of a deal this is.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Again, I’m preaching to the choir.</p>
<p class="p1">So, once you’ve decided which platform, or have narrowed it down to two, you will switch to, ask immediately about migration and transfer services.</p>
<p class="p1">And don’t let an unclear answer pass.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Many ecommerce platforms will pass you off to a partner for catalog transfer services, adding anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 to your initial launch fee and 6 weeks to 6 months in go-to-market timing.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">That’s a lot of money and time – and can significantly affect total cost of ownership.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do not sign a contract until you have this information. If you are passed off to partner, talk to that partner immediately.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Get a solid understanding of how the catalog transfer or data migration will be done and similar stores they have already transferred, ideally from the same platform you are on. Reach out to that brand, too, and ask about the service.</p>
<p class="p1">Better yet, choose an ecommerce platform that provides this service in-house.</p>
<p class="p1">At BigCommerce, they have a team of dedicated experts with a combined 30+ years in ecommerce and 15+ years in catalog transfer services.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In the last three years alone, they have transferred more than 20,000 online stores from 50 different ecommerce technology platforms. The service typically take 4-8 weeks for GTM.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This comes at little to no additional cost to a brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Because their team has worked with so many brands, they’ve learned that every single online store is unique, and that as they’ve scaled, so has their service.</p>
<p class="p1">To ensure catalog &amp; customer data is transferred successfully, our catalog transfer services team implements a 3 steps quality assurance process.</p>
<p class="p1">This process includes spot checking the data on your new BigCommerce store. The team’s goal is to transfer these items safely, swiftly and securely.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Top 5 Data Migration Myths Debunked</h2>
<p class="p1">In the course of performing so many transfers, our team has spoken to a diverse group of business owners, walking them through the process of moving to a new platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Below are the top five myths they’ve heard about catalog transfers.</p>
<h3 class="p3">1. Data Migration Myth #1: We miss out on sales while you transfer our data.</h3>
<p class="p1">Your store won’t go offline during the transfer process.</p>
<p class="p1">We do all the work on your new BigCommerce store backend, then give you as much time as you need to customize your settings, test your site and train your team.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">When you’re ready, and only when you’re ready, you can launch your new ecommerce storefront — complete with updated data already uploaded into your backend.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This allows you to continue business as usual from day one.</p>
<p class="p1">While all of this is happening, your original store stays live on your current platform. We don’t require that it come down, and BigCommerce and our global network of partners actually advise against it.</p>
<p class="p1">We understand that uptime is one of the most crucial factors to gaining and maintaining consumer trust, so all our work can happen with no downtime required.</p>
<h3 class="p3">2. Data Migration Myth #2: We’ll lose our design if we replatform.</h3>
<p class="p1">Worrying about losing your beautiful, custom design? Don’t.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce’s open template files allow you to bring custom design elements to your new store, and our design partners, ensure that it happens seamlessly.</p>
<p class="p1">Check out a full list of BigCommerce’s best designed customer sites – and how those designs have increased conversion.</p>
<h3 class="p3">3. Data Migration Myth #3: When we move the store to a new host, we’ll lose all our traffic.</h3>
<p class="p1">It is true that moving to a new server, even when using the same domain name, can impact search engine rankings if done improperly.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">The good news, though, is that people move servers all the time, and search engines like Google have best practices which mitigate the effects.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">We follow those best practices to minimize all controllable risk. We properly implement 301 redirects for your product and category pages.</p>
<p class="p1">Our goal is to move your product data with the same search ranking foundation you had built on your previous platform.</p>
<p class="p1">That way, our SEO-friendly platform can quickly drive your traffic to new heights.</p>
<h3 class="p3">4. Data Migration Myth #4: Replatforming means we can clone our store exactly.</h3>
<p class="p1">No, you cannot clone your store exactly.</p>
<p class="p1">You can, however, transfer a majority of your existing data from your current ecommerce store to your new backend. In fact, we make sure that happens without opening you up to any potential issues or liabilities.</p>
<p class="p1">As for your store’s look and feel, you’re probably thinking about leaving your current platform because it’s lacking in some way, so why would you want to recreate those same shortfalls?</p>
<p class="p1">The quicker you embrace the idea that it requires some change to improve your online business, the quicker you can benefit from transferring to a fully featured enterprise solution like BigCommerce.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">We offer a wealth of next-level features that will ensure your transition is as painless — and profitable — as possible.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">For instance, with dozens of integrated payment gateways, you’ll rarely need a payment option we don’t offer. Chances are that we have an integration with the payment gateway you are using right now, and you may even find new options like Square and PayPal powered by Braintree that you like more.</p>
<p class="p1">In all, BigCommerce offers more than 250 one-click integrations with leading software providers like Survey Monkey, HubSpot, Alibaba and Salesforce. That makes it easy to integrate with the tools you already use.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, our open and unrestricted API blows our competitors out of the water.</p>
<p class="p1">Seamlessly connect to critical business software with a powerful API that processes updates up to 100x faster than Shopify Plus.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce can handle 100’s of API calls per second. Shopify Plus limits you to 10 per second. Performing an ERP inventory sync of 25,000 products and variants on BigCommerce would take 60 seconds, compared to 2hrs using the Shopify Plus API.</p>
<h3 class="p3">5. Data Migration Myth #5: We have great engineers. We can do it ourselves.</h3>
<p class="p1">Even if you’re a great developer, our experience has taught us that the first time you undertake an unfamiliar task like this, it rarely goes according to plan.</p>
<p class="p1">Anybody who has tried to renovate their own house knows how steep the learning curve can be.</p>
<p class="p1">Wouldn’t your time be better spent growing your business and serving your customers while delegating your transfer to veteran engineers who can get it done quickly and correctly?</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Your data isn’t something you want to risk, and we’ve heard our fair share of self-transfer horror stories.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">When you’re talking about securing and improving your financial future, you can’t afford to let your ego get in the way. Instead, trust your migration to an industry-leading team with more than 20,000 successful migrations completed.</p>
<p class="p1">For more information on BigCommerce’s transfer services, read our support documentation on how to move your store to BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">And know, this is only documentation. You’ll have an account manager and on-boarding consultant by your side, handling all the heavy lifting, every step of the way.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Tools to Help You Make the Move Now</h2>
<p class="p1">In all, figuring out which ecommerce platform is right for your business is a time consuming task. But a proper replatforming project is well worth the wait.</p>
<p class="p1">A modern ecommerce backend allows you to streamline processes while increasing site speed, stability and security to outperform industry standards.</p>
<p class="p1">SaaS works the way technology should – behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, it does so cost effectively, allowing you to invest in marketing initiatives that drive growth for your brand.</p>

<p>All of these tools are meant for teams of all sizes. There are companies like Airbnb, HootSuite, and TGI Fridays managing parts of their operations with Wrike.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wrike&#8217;s interface is intuitive and clean so that small businesses and new users can jump right in. Not only that, but there&#8217;s a free pricing plan along with a professional plan for only $9.80 per user per month.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s quite affordable for a small business.</p>
<h2>The Best Bunch of Features from Wrike</h2>
<p>Although the features vary from plan to plan, it&#8217;s worth looking into the standout tools that could potentially turn your online or physical store into a more efficient enterprise.</p>
<h3>A Large Collection of Integrations</h3>

<h3>Project Management with Timelines and Resource Management</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13607" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="338" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-1.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/chart-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Along with live editing, file management, and request forms, the project management module delivers Gantt-chart timelines for you to visualize your entire project schedule. There&#8217;s also a beautiful resource management area for adjusting where your most valuable assets need to go.</p>
<h3>Collaboration With Live Streams and Great Communication Tools</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13608" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="371" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-2.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/communications-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Wrike has quick real-time communication tools like live chats, tagging, and an option to chat with people outside of your company. The personal dashboard is where most of the action takes place. You can work on proofing and approvals, and check the live stream to see exactly what everyone is working on.</p>
<h3>Customization for Fields, Workflows, and User Groups</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13609" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="369" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-3.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/workflow-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Customization comes into play for a project management software since you&#8217;re trying to give your team more flexibility and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wrike has options for inserting whatever custom fields you want. You can also create your own user groups, project dashboards, and workflows. In short, it&#8217;s all about matching how your team works.</p>
<h2>Who Should Consider Wrike For Project Management?</h2>
<p>Wrike has clients from all over the world, so it has developed plans and features for several types of organizations, large and small.</p>
<p>For instance, marketers have been known to enjoy Wrike for its ability to coordinate across teams and manage events. The resource and workload management is an upside for marketers, and so is the time tracking.</p>
<p>We also like it for marketing agencies, product development, project managers, and team leaders.</p>
<p>For example, some product development professionals utilize Wrike as a way to create, prioritize, and assign requirements to track the development in real-time. This allows you to manage your resources wisely, centralize your product vision, and accelerate delivery.</p>

<h2>Wrike Review: The Pricing</h2>
<p>As we mentioned a little earlier in this Wrike review, the platform starts with a Free plan, which works great for sharing tasks within small teams.</p>
<p>In addition to that, each plan above that has a free trial for you and your company to try it out before committing to any payments.</p>
<p>This pricing setup appears transparent and inexpensive. It&#8217;s also nice that you have some flexibility just in case you need to upgrade or downgrade depending on your company growth.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the pricing plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> &#8211; For $0 per month, you receive tools for task management, file sharing, real-time activity stream, a spreadsheet view, basic integrations, iPhone and Android apps, cloud storage, and 2GB of space.</li>
<li><strong>Professional</strong> &#8211; $9.80 per user per month supports 5-15 users, all features from the previous plan, task and subtask management, a dynamic timeline, advanced integrations, shareable dashboards, unlimited collaborators, from 5GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong> &#8211; $24.80 per user per month supports 5-15 users, all features from the previous plan, custom fields and workflows, shared real-time reports, report templates, graphical analytics, resource management, request forms, time tracking, user groups and permissions, Salesforce integration, a branded workspace, from 50GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
<li><strong>Marketers</strong> &#8211; $34.60 per user per month supports 5-200 users, all features from the previous plan, video proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud extension, a tailored workspace, from 5GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise</strong> &#8211; This plan requires you to contact Wrike for pricing, but it has support for up to unlimited users, all features from the previous plans, Active Directory integration, SAML 2.0 single sign-on, two-factor authentication, password policies, IT-controlled admin permissions, user audit reports, network access and compliance policies, from 100GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with a Chrome extension and its availability in 10 languages like English, Spanish, Italian, and German, the pricing is rather impressive.</p>
<h2>Is Wrike Right For You?</h2>
<p>One of the last elements I like to examine involves customer service. To start, Wrike runs a wonderful blog, releasing tips, stories, and news to guide you in the world of collaboration, leadership, and productivity.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of resources and free eBooks for marketers, project managers, and other collaborators.</p>
<p>Wrike also includes a solid help center for all customers, along with community forums, webinars, consultation services, and a translation portal.</p>
<p>Wrike is one of the most impressive project management tools available on the market and makes sense for online stores and regular businesses, big and small.</p>
<p><em>Okay, I promise this will be the last time- the pricing is sweet!</em></p>
