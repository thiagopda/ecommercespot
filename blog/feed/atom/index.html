<p class="p1">Whether you’re looking to start up an online business or diversify your offering to scale your current ecommerce business, you need two very specific things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">a product idea. </li>
<li class="p1">a sourcing method.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Product ideas can be difficult to come by, especially ones with true market viability.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">But coming up with the idea is often less challenging than the sourcing of those products – so I found out.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Sourcing is a crucial business process for every retailer, and there are four main ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Make</li>
<li class="p1">Manufacture</li>
<li class="p1">Dropship</li>
<li class="p1">Wholesale</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are pros and cons to each method and many retailers use a combination, or all four, to truly scale.</p>
<p class="p1">Typically, only those brands with high revenues and margins can account for the initial spend, and continuous upkeep, required to offer customers the best of all sourcing methods: unique products in combination with anything and everything else for which they may be looking.</p>
<p class="p1">These brands are often considered lifestyle brands, offering everything a customer might need to live a particular way –– think Goop, ShopBop, Madewell, ModCloth, among others.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Small businesses have long been hindered by the price barrier here, but one big name brand making serious headlines is changing all of that – enter, Alibaba.com.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<h2 class="p1">What is Alibaba?</h2>
<p class="p1">If you follow business or ecommerce news in the slightest, you’ve heard of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company providing manufacturing sourcing options for businesses of all sizes at incredibly affordable prices.</p>
<p class="p1">In all, Alibaba doesn’t operate exactly like any other ecommerce company out there.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">For one thing, Alibaba is a comprehensive directory of suppliers, connecting them directly to buyers from all over the world (i.e. retailers).</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Alibaba presents millions of products to source, all from the suppliers themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">In essence, you are  getting supplier prices at insider rates, typically at a price point only senior and seriously connected merchandisers have before been able to nab.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Alibaba levels the sourcing playing field for legacy brands and small businesses alike.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">How do I know that Alibaba is leveling the playing field for all businesses?</p>
<p class="p1">Because I started an online business myself, sourced from Alibaba and am seeing huge success.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s exactly how I did it (and you can, too).</p>
<h2 class="p3">How To Source Products from Alibaba to Start an Online Business</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve always wanted to start my own online business.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">But wanting to start your own business is one thing; actually doing it is another.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">So, in 2017, I made a New Year’s resolution to start an online business – and I kept it.</p>
<p class="p1">I finally was able to get my business off the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">The sense of fulfillment, excitement and pride that I’ve experienced every day since starting my online business has been unmatched.</p>
<p class="p1">And I did it by starting with sourcing from Alibaba to get my brand up and running, and making money.</p>
<p class="p1">In this, you’ll learn how to :</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Use Alibaba to make money</li>
<li class="p1">Use Alibaba to start a business</li>
<li class="p1">Find the right supplier on Alibaba</li>
<li class="p1">Source products from Alibaba</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Plus, I’ll cover FAQs I hear from folks when I talk about this subject, as well as things I wish I’d known when I began.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s get going.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Finding a Profitable Product Niche on Alibaba</h2>
<p class="p1">One of the most difficult parts of starting my business was finding a product.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">I had dreams. I had passion. I didn’t actually have anything to sell.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Here’s where I was mentally:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How would I even find a product to sell?</li>
<li class="p1">What are other folks selling?</li>
<li class="p1">Would I fail?</li>
<li class="p1">Would I get lucky?</li>
<li class="p1">Was I pretender?</li>
<li class="p1">A contender?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I had no idea. And I soon came to learn, that’s OK.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fear is good.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Fear is what got me to start. It’s what pushed me to search harder. And it’s what brings me to today, a year later –– when I’m able to share with you exactly how I did it, and how you can, too.</p>
<h3 class="p5">1. Do market research to find a product to sell.</h3>
<p class="p1">I did some research on items selling well online, as well as some inner reflection to see if I could find a product that would help solve a problem I experienced in my day to day as a dog owner, athlete, urban dweller and traveler.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Using Google Trends, I was able to understand search volume and interest in a number of different products.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27096 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="234" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-1-300x94.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Google Trends is often a great place to find whether items are trending.</em></p>
<p class="p1">And then one day, that proverbial light bulb went on.</p>
<p class="p1">As an avid music fan that attends a number of concerts and music festivals, I noticed a need for lighter, compact bags that would be able to hold festival essentials:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Sunglasses.</li>
<li class="p1">Water bottles.</li>
<li class="p1">Wallets.</li>
<li class="p1">Keys.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Security restrictions prevented the use of larger backpacks and bags.</p>
<p class="p1">Festival attendees were left stranded.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Where there’s pain, however, there’s opportunity to do something better.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">I decided I could fix this. I could be a part of the solution.</p>
<h4 class="p6">Could I Be the Next Bag Guy?</h4>
<p class="p1">I decided to start my own private label brand of bags and fanny packs: Who’s Your Fanny .</p>
<p class="p1">Early on, I decided that my business would begin as a private label business.</p>
<p class="p1">I’d sell via a ecommerce site on BigCommerce and Amazon.</p>
<div class="post-detail__crosslink post-detail__style-light">
<p class="h3">The Definitive Guide to Selling on Amazon</p>
</p>
<p class="p4">This book is no joke. I read it to get started on Amazon – and continue to reference is to grow sales.</p>
<p class="p4">MSNBC has recommended it. Inc.com has recommended it. I recommend it.</p>
<p class="p4">What more do you need?</p>
<p>Get the book now</p></div>
<h3 class="p5">2. Validate your idea.</h3>
<p class="p1">Great. So, I have an idea. That’s a start.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that I had an idea that resonated with me, I needed to validate that this was actually a problem.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Moreover, I needed to validate that even if it were a problem, that I could solve it.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Most importantly, I wanted to hear from prospective customers.</p>
<p class="p1">So, I asked:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Friends (and friends of friends).</li>
<li class="p1">Random people on the internet.</li>
<li class="p1">Co-workers.</li>
<li class="p1">Google, and evaluated search volume trends.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I asked questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What pain points have you experienced.</li>
<li class="p1">What sorts of bags have you purchased in the past.</li>
<li class="p1">How much have you paid.</li>
<li class="p1">How much would you be willing to pay, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I also pulled up that Google Trends thing again.</p>
<p class="p1">And it looked like fanny packs (or bum bags, waist packs, sling bags – whatever you want to call them) were rising in popularity:</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27097 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business.png" alt="" width="910" height="366" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business.png 910w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-2-300x121.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-2-750x302.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /></p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">My “mini focus groups” had a lot to say. I had no idea people were so passionate about what they used to carry their stuff.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">But through that, I identified some crucial elements any solid fanny pack would need to have.</p>
<p class="p1">I quickly learned that my target customers wanted:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Multiple pockets. Compartmentalization was a must.</li>
<li class="p1">An adjustable belt was key.</li>
<li class="p1">Some preferred low price; others preferred a cute design.</li>
<li class="p1">Amazon was where they often began their product search.</li>
<li class="p1">Guys and girls had different tastes.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">And there I had it.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">I had a product.</li>
<li class="p1">A product that customers would be interested in buying.</li>
<li class="p1">And my focus group could also serve as my first customers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">But, I still had no idea how I would source this magical fanny pack.</p>
<p class="p1">Off to finding a supplier or a manufacturer&#8230;</p>
<h3 class="p5">3. Find the best way to source your product.</h3>
<p class="p1">There are several options to source a product, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Direct wholesale.</li>
<li class="p1">Privately branding your own products.</li>
<li class="p1">Dropshipping, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I had to narrow my search.</p>
<p class="p1">So, as I picked an option, I determined that I would pick the path that best met the below criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Sourcing must be easy.</li>
<li class="p1">Cost of goods sold must be low to ensure good margins.</li>
<li class="p1">Products must be tested, reliable and high quality.</li>
<li class="p1">Manufacturer must be scalable and grow with my business.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p6">Criteria To Make Sourcing Easy</h4>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Running a business often means, on any day, you’ve got 99 problems and I really didn’t want sourcing to be one.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">I wanted to make sure I had this down pat so that I could focus on running the day-to-day of my business.</p>
<p class="p1">In general, the framework I used to determine whether my sourcing option was easy often came to whether I could find my ideal product.</p>
<p class="p1">My criteria for my product being:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Is the product light and easy to ship?</li>
<li class="p1">Is the product price low enough per unit to have a solid margin?</li>
<li class="p1">Does the product have health risks? No food. No electronics. Nothing like that.</li>
<li class="p1">I wanted to know my product and have used one before: As an avid festival goer, I had.</li>
<li class="p1">Confirmed there was a market for the product: My mini focus group did that.</li>
<li class="p1">Confirmed there was an easy place to source the product from: For this my options were clear –– now I had to decide where I’d source from (Spoiler alert: Alibaba).</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p5">4. Decide where you are going to source.</h3>
<p class="p1">I explored a number of options including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Dropshippers like Printful and Printify.</li>
<li class="p1">Wholesale marketplaces like Alibaba and DHGate.</li>
<li class="p1">Local manufacturers/wholesalers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Today, a year later, the business operates with a mix of suppliers.</p>
<p class="p1">But back then, a year ago, I started with Alibaba as my only supply source.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why I Chose Alibaba</h2>
<p class="p1">I chose Alibaba for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>I wanted to find reputable fanny pack manufacturers</strong> who had been doing this for a while, and Alibaba had plenty of those.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>I was looking for a known marketplace</strong> so that there would be a lot of information on the web about how to use it. Alibaba checked that box.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>I wanted to ensure that there were rules and regulations</strong> on the marketplace to protect myself and any investment I made. On Alibaba, there are rules on how manufacturers and suppliers should behave. There are also tools out there to make sourcing easy on Alibaba. There are reviews of manufacturers, trade assurance options, various security levers. All of these things gave me confidence in exploring it as a sourcing platform.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>I needed something could fit my budget</strong>, so that my investment wasn’t monumental on an idea I was only testing. This was the biggest winner for Alibaba. There, I quickly found products that fit within my budget, manufacturers I enjoyed working with and ones that gave me confidence to move to the next steps in building my business.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Now that I had chosen Alibaba, let’s dive in to what happened next and how you can do the exact same thing.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Exactly How to Use Alibaba to Source Products</h2>
<h3 class="p5">1. Setup your Alibaba account.</h3>
<p class="p1">I did a lot of research prior to beginning my journey but today, I’ll save you all of that time and share what I learned.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">The first step to using Alibaba is to set up a User ID and password.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This is fairly easy to do and straightforward. While Alibaba is based in China, the user interface is in English (and other languages) and caters to a number of different markets.</p>
<h3 class="p5">2. Understand Alibaba.</h3>
<p class="p1">When you get into Alibaba (after you’ve decided on a product), you’ll want to search for a manufacturer.</p>
<p class="p1">On Alibaba, you have 2 types of manufacturers:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Factory:</strong> This is the actual factory that will be producing your sourced goods. Many factories have their own sales teams to deal with retailers like you. Often times, trading companies will source from factories.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Trading Company:</strong> A middleman that sources straight from the factory and sells to you. In some cases, it may be difficult to find a factory that produces your goods, but a trading company can assist.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">It’s important to pick which option is right for your business. Many of these manufacturers are flexible in how they work with your business.  </p>
<p class="p1">Both a trading company or straight from the factory can be a good option, so it’s really up to you to determine how you like to work, your relationship and comfort level with the company, the quality of the product and so on.</p>
<h3 class="p5">3. Be smart how you search Alibaba.</h3>
<p class="p1">In the next few sections, I will detail the steps to source a product on Alibaba.</p>
<h4 class="p6">Sample Product Search on Alibaba</h4>
<p class="p1">In this example, we’ll be taking on the role of a hypothetical hat manufacturer because it meets the criteria we established earlier (easy to ship, low cost, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">We’ll source for our hat company together and will go through the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Finding a Supplier</li>
<li class="p1">Picking a Supplier</li>
<li class="p1">Contacting the Supplier</li>
<li class="p1">Securing a Sample</li>
<li class="p1">Reviewing Your Sample</li>
<li class="p1">Placing Your Mass Quantity Order</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In this journey, we’ll be (together) starting a hat company.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve picked hats because it meets all of our sourcing criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Hats are light and easy to ship</li>
<li class="p1">We can source at a low price and sell at a competitive price</li>
<li class="p1">Hats have few health risks</li>
<li class="p1">I feel like I understand the market for hats (I’ve worn one)</li>
<li class="p1">There is a market for hats.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, go to Alibaba and type in “hats” into the the search bar under “products” and hit Search.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In this instance, we’ve picked a broad search term, but the more specific you can be, the better.</p>
<p class="p1">For example if you are looking for a “winter beanie for women” then you should start with a search for a term like that to get you the best supplier options.</p>
<p class="p1">There you’ll find a number of options. Immediately, you’ll ask yourself “how do I choose…”</p>

<li class="p1"><strong>MOQ:</strong> This is the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) requirement on Alibaba. It specifies the lowest quantity of a certain product that a supplier is willing to sell. If you cannot reach the MOQ requirement, then the supplier is not willing to enter production.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>OEM:</strong> OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing. You can come with your own specifications, your own requirements, your own detailed visions of your product and hand them off to an OEM factory. The OEM will start manufacturing your product from scratch. This is the kind of supplier you should looking for if you want a unique product under your brand name.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>ODM:</strong> ODM stands for Original Design Manufacturing. An ODM factory will give you products ideas. Give the factory some expected functions, some expected performance and some expected ideas of the conceptions and the factory will suggest some final product options. Don’t know how to build a product? An ODM factory can help.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Trade Assurance:</strong> If you have a dispute with your supplier, you can submit a claim to Alibaba. They’ll review it, and If they agree that the factory has not made good on their promises, they may give you your money back. Just keep in mind that from the very beginning your sales agreement must list the points that could cause a dispute, like QC, lead times, etc.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Gold Supplier:</strong> The factory is paying Alibaba to appear more favorably in the search results. It’s a good thing. The factory is pushing their business forward, so take it as a good sign.</li>
<li class="p1">Assessed Supplier: Alibaba has had a third-party company visit the factory to check out their facilities.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>QC process:</strong> Alibaba has lots of quality control processes and terms. Here we go:
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>IQC:</strong> Incoming Quality Control means the control of raw materials or anything that enters the factory (the workplace) for the manufacturing of goods and products.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>OQC:</strong> Outgoing quality control is concerned with the finished goods ready for shipment.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>QC &amp; QA:</strong> Quality Control and Quality Assurance are the ways that quality is controlled and assured during all the process.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>IPQC:</strong> In Process Quality Control is made during all steps of the manufacturing of a given product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FOB:</span> </strong>Free on Board (or Freight on Board). This means that the cost of delivering the goods to the nearest port is included but YOU, as the buyer, are responsible for the shipping from there and all other fees associated with getting the goods to your country/address</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>CIF:</strong> Cost insurance and Freight (named port of destination). Seller must pay the costs and freight includes insurance to bring the goods to the port of destination. However, risk is transferred to the buyer once the goods are loaded on the ship.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 class="p6">Back To Our Product Search</h4>
<p class="p1">So, looking at our hat search one more time, we have a number of options.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Knowing that this is my first search, I’d like to ensure there are controls in place with a reliable supplier so I select trade assurance, which allows me to pay via escrow after I receive my goods.</li>
<li class="p1">Also, for added protection, I select “Gold Suppliers,” Alibaba’s top suppliers. While Alibaba is largely safe, there are still all sorts of suppliers on there and these can help you feel more confident you’ll interact with an honest supplier.</li>
<li class="p1">To further narrow my search, full well knowing that I’m just getting started, I select a manufacturer with a low MOQ of 100.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can select a MOQ that you are comfortable with but 100-200 is a good range for just getting started.</p>
<p class="p1">Per unit prices will start getting much less expensive at the 500+ range, but you will get there in due time.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27098 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="469" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-3.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3 class="p5">4. Pick a supplier on Alibaba.</h3>
<p class="p1">After we’ve inserted this criteria, a number of suppliers will appear.</p>
<p class="p1">As you look through the options, you’ll want to consider a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Price.</li>
<li class="p1">Minimum order quantity.</li>
<li class="p1">Time listed on Alibaba.</li>
<li class="p1">Time listed as a Gold Supplier.</li>
<li class="p1">Supplier reputation and reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In evaluating supplier reputation and reviews, I ask myself a few questions as I evaluate whether the supplier is legitimate.</p>
<p class="p1">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How structured and detailed is their page?</li>
<li class="p1">Do they have pictures of the factory? Detailed information about the location and history?</li>
<li class="p1">Do they have professional descriptions and images of the products?</li>
<li class="p1">Do they describe their QC process and delivery times?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Asking and answering these questions should take out much of the fear from your Alibaba search and can help ensure that you work with legitimate factories and suppliers.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It’s unfortunate, but there are definitely scammers and fraudsters on Alibaba. However, there are ways to avoid them.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Many of the details in this article can help ensure you are working with well-intentioned, reputable, reliable, secure manufacturers.</p>
<p class="p1">In this example, I quickly identify a supplier that has a good track record, a number of transactions, and has a good response rate.</p>
<p class="p1">The MOQ is slightly higher than I’d like, but it’s OK.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27099 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-4.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="453" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-4.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-3-300x181.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-3.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Now, you’ll want to email several suppliers.</p>
<h3 class="p5">5. Contact the supplier.</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you’ve identified some suppliers that meet your criteria (low MOQ, gold, trade, etc.) you’ll be able to shoot them a note and get additional details.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few tips on outreach:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Keep it short and sweet</li>
<li class="p1">Introduce yourself &amp; your business</li>
<li class="p1">Describe what you are interested in  </li>
<li class="p1">Inquire about shipping times and sample cost</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In short, your end goal is to determine which suppliers can meet your basic requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Depending on your budget, you’ll want to engage a few suppliers for your product. I typically reach out to 5-10 and track my findings in a Google Sheet or Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">When you engage these suppliers, you’ll interact with them to secure a sample.</p>
<p class="p1">A few things to know about samples:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Samples are important because you’ll want to see the product prior to selling it and investing more money into inventory.</li>
<li class="p1">Many manufacturers will charge for express shipping via DHL, UPS, FedEx to ensure you get your samples quickly.</li>
<li class="p1">In some cases, they’ll also charge you for a sample, which can often be refunded once you pick them and place a larger order.</li>
</ul>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">Why do Alibaba Suppliers Charge for Samples?</h6>
<p class="p1">Alibaba suppliers often charge for samples and sample shipping to vet that you’re serious about the business relationship. Both sides (you and the manufacturer) want to establish trust.</p>
</div>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">For a business starting out, I’d also suggest sticking to low MOQs to test and validate products before going all-in.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This allows you to build trust with your manufacturer to ensure they’ll be able to deliver larger high-quality orders when the time comes.</p>
<p class="p1">As you build a relationship with an Alibaba supplier, you’ll be able to purchase in bulk, which will give you lower per unit items.</p>
<p class="p1">But in this initial stage, you’re focused on delivering a viable product.</p>
<p class="p1">A note like this should work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Hi,</p>
<p class="p1">I am a retailer exploring supplier options for my business in Austin, Texas. I am interested in a sample of your hat and am curious as to how much it will cost to ship this item to Austin, Texas. Additionally, I would like to confirm the price per order for your minimum order quantity, as well as turn-around and delivery time.</p>
<p class="p1">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;x&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Most Alibaba suppliers respond within 24-48 hours.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In your communication you’ll want to look out for a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Does the prospective manufacturer answer all of my questions?</li>
<li class="p1">Do they communicate clearly?</li>
<li class="p1">Do they show that they can meet your basic requirements?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">I’ve been very impressed with the relationship management Alibaba suppliers offer. Seriously, no complaints there at all.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">With that said, Alibaba suppliers are bombarded with emails on a daily basis and it’s important to let them know that you are a legitimate customer.</p>
<p class="p1">You will want to ensure that you respond in a timely manner to any Alibaba correspondence.</p>
<h3 class="p5">6. Secure the sample.</h3>
<p class="p1">Eventually, your supplier will reach back out to you.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">They will provide answers to your questions and in some cases, offer to chat via WeChat or Skype to further discuss your request.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If you have the time, definitely take them up on it.</p>
<p class="p1">There you can discuss more details about any product customizations you are requesting, pricing and other questions in deeper detail.</p>
<p class="p1">With that said, it is not required and you can still place your initial order via email.</p>
<p class="p1">After confirming details with you, they’ll either ask for a small nominal charge plus shipping for the sample.</p>
<p class="p1">This small fee does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">It often weeds out non-legitimate customers</li>
<li class="p1">Pays for express shipping.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">One thing that is important to remember is that sample costs can quickly add up.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Be selective in who you request samples from otherwise you may find yourself having lost a small fortune as you scope out new vendors.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">At the end of the day you’re looking to source a quality product that will still deliver your target profitability per unit. It’s OK to be selective.</p>
<p class="p1">If it is a trade assurance supplier, they will send you an order in your Alibaba Control Panel confirming your order and transaction details.</p>
<p class="p1">You can pay for your order via Credit Card, your bank account or AliPay.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Since you have Trade Assurance, payment will not be charged until after you receive the goods. This builds shopper confidence as you are only charged once you confirm receipt of the goods.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If you’ve used a trade assurance manufacturer, at this point you’ll be able to pay for the samples and upon receipt, will be asked to confirm via Trade Assurance.</p>
<p class="p1">Depending on whether you are private labeling your product or selling the product as-is, the next steps might be slightly different.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">If you are planning on selling the product as-is, you’re done. If you’re private labeling like I did, continue.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="p5">7. How to private label products from Alibaba.</h3>
<p class="p1">There are two types of private labeling that is possible with products from Alibaba.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">ODM</li>
<li class="p1">OEM</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Let’s look at both.</p>
<h4 class="p6">What is ODM on Alibaba?</h4>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p8">With ODM, you are essentially buying a relatively finished product and throwing your label on it. You may have a few small tweaks as well.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If you’re planning on private labeling the product, you most likely will have a set of designs you expect to print on the pre-manufactured item as well as a tag that has your brand name and other information.</p>
<p class="p1">For this, you can use “ODM.”</p>
<h4 class="p6">What is OEM on Alibaba?</h4>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">OEM is when you start something completely from scratch.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">In your discussions with the manufacturer, if you have a design that you’d like on this hypothetical hat, you can send them artwork (often in the form of .jpg, AI, etc.) and for a small charge, they’ll be able to put this on your sample.</p>
<p class="p1">This is often called “OEM.”</p>
<p class="p1">I would highly recommend securing a sample prior to placing a large order, especially if this is your first product.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are opting for the private label route, you can also often put a tag on the product with your brand.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27100 size-medium" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-5.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-5.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-4.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A copy of my own private label used in my fanny packs.</p>
<h4 class="p6">And Now You Wait</h4>
<p class="p1">It will take a few days/weeks for the sample to arrive, but being the budding entrepreneur you are, this gives you time to build out other elements of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">Use this time to learn more about Amazon and set up your ecommerce site with stock photography and sample descriptions.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are sourcing additional products continue explorations. Sourcify is a great option for this.</p>
<h3 class="p5">8. Analyze samples to ensure quality.</h3>
<p class="p1">Once your sample arrives, you’ll want to check for a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Does this sample look like the pictures?</li>
<li class="p1">What is the quality of the product? Is it durable? How’s the stitching?</li>
<li class="p1">Is the packaging what I expected? Do I need to request something different?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Feel free to take the product for a test run.</p>
<p class="p1">Pretend you&#8217;re a customer buying your product:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How does it feel?</li>
<li class="p1">Does it accomplish the task?</li>
<li class="p1">Does it solve the problem you’re solving?</li>
<li class="p1">Feel free to also show others.</li>
<li class="p1">Remember that focus group? Maybe you bring it as your next show-and-tell item. Find your least shy friends that also sit in your target market. Ask and hold your breath.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I’m just kidding. Don’t hold your breath. But definitely get feedback! Feedback is important.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Additionally, you’ll want to be sure that the price for this product will deliver you your targeted profitability per unit.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If the sample is amazing, but the per unit cost will come at an unprofitable price, you should continue to explore additional manufacturers/suppliers.</p>
<h3 class="p5">9. Place your order.</h3>
<p class="p1">We like our sample and are ready to move forward.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you can reach back out to your supplier to let them know that you like the sample and to discuss terms for your larger purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">These details include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Price per unit</li>
<li class="p1">Order quantity</li>
<li class="p1">Delivery time</li>
<li class="p1">Shipping method</li>
<li class="p1">Address.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The supplier will send you a trade assurance order form and you’ll place your order.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">From there, you’ll wait for your products, most likely anywhere from 15-45 days, depending on order size, factory and backlog.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">For example, if you’re ordering from China during Chinese New Year, expect a delay as many factories shut down for the holiday.</p>
<p class="p1">At less busy times, you might be able to receive your product sooner.</p>
<h4 class="p6">They’re Here! They’re Here!</h4>
<p class="p1">In a couple of weeks (depending on the size of your order), you should receive your products.</p>
<p class="p1">When they get to you, be sure to inspect them (you’ll want to do this for your future orders as well).</p>
<p class="p1">Hopefully, the count you ordered, the design and the workmanship will be similar to your sample (and you should be ready to start selling).</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, take a picture for your product photography and get your products live on your site. And you have your private label product!</p>
<h3 class="p5">10. Continue to get feedback on your product.</h3>
<p class="p1">After you launch, be sure to monitor your inventory levels.</p>
<p class="p1">Ultimately, you’re going to want to decide as to whether your product will remain viable (i.e. maintain margins, low return rate, etc.) or whether demand is actually quite low.</p>
<p class="p1">If you do find that your product is successful, you can reach out to your supplier and place larger orders.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Remember to continue getting feedback on your products from prospects and customers.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">For any entrepreneur pursuing a private label business, I would encourage you to “follow a passion” or “sell something you know.”</p>
<p class="p1">Take it step by step and have fun!</p>
<p class="p1">I continue to grow my business and learn more and more each day.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>I am so happy that I made that tipsy New Year’s resolution in 2017 and look forward to hearing about your journeys as well.</strong></p>
<h2 class="p3">Sourcing from Alibaba FAQs</h2>
<h3 class="p5">How does Alibaba work?</h3>
<p class="p1">Once you create an account with Alibaba, you can begin sourcing your products immediately.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike dropshipping, when you source through Alibaba you will need to house all products yourself. Whether you do that in your home garage or a distribution center is up to you, though there are particular small business tax benefits in the U.S. for designating a spot in your home for this, especially for small businesses.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Also keep in mind that you will need to buy your products via Alibaba in bulk (i.e. by the dozen or more).</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">You will also want to be sure that the products you purchase are market viable, meaning that there is a demand for what you will sell.</p>
<p class="p1">Things to keep in mind as you browse products on Alibaba:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Unit Price:</strong> Because Alibaba allows suppliers to sell directly to retailers, prices are generally much lower than you’ll find for similar products elsewhere. This means you can increase your margins. That said, you’ll see FOB often on Alibaba. FOB stands for Free On Board and means that the seller is responsible for all costs associated with getting the product to the dock. After that point, the buyer is responsible for all costs related to transportation from the dock to the store owner.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Minimum Order Quantity:</strong> This is simply the minimum order amount that the supplier is willing to accept. Keep in mind that this is negotiable, especially with the increased fees associated with shipping once the product reaches port.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Payment Options:</strong> For most buyers, you’ll likely want to utilize PayPal as your payment option. Escrow is also a good option for buyers, and more often preferred by suppliers. Check out Alibaba’s Payments Page for more information all all available payment options.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">How does Alibaba handle quality control?</h3>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Like any online platform, scammers and hackers are always a possibility.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Alibaba consistently works to track down and take out those who are masquerading as manufacturers (but whom simply mark up prices, then buy from the suppliers themselves, effectively making them middlemen), and scammers.</p>
<p class="p1">For buyers, there are multiple ways to ensure that you avoid falling prey to these activities.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Choose Escrow as a Payment Option:</strong> The escrow payment option holds your payment in escrow (i.e. does not go to seller) until you report back that you have received the products and they are to the quality and quantity expected. This payment option will save you from scammers, though not necessarily false manufacturers. This method will also give you the power to actual see and feel your product before you pay, essentially solving for quality control issues despite your supplier preferences.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Contact the Supplier:</strong> Sourcing products from overseas can be a bit daunting and frightening for many small businesses. If you are wary about who you are purchasing from, ask them for a contact and set up a call. Skype works perfectly for this, plus you’ll be able to get a sense of the business and the people you will be working with.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Request a Quote:</strong> RFQ (request for quote), is a simple process and part of the daily interactions between suppliers and buyers. This is your opportunity as a buyer to feel out a supplier’s process as well as negotiate. Simply send the supplier an email and be sure to request information regarding minimum order quantities, production time and pricing, pricing for samples and payment options.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Verify Suppliers:</strong> Much like eBay and Amazon, Alibaba has a verification system for suppliers, alerting buyers to the historical accuracy of individual manufacturers. Below is a chart showing the different levels of verification. Look for these before you decide to purchase from a supplier.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27094 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-complete-guide-to-sourcing-from-alibaba-and-building-an-online-business-1.png" alt="" width="750" height="459" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-5.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/buying-from-alibaba-example-5-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3 class="p5">Is Alibaba Safe? How can I avoid purchasing counterfeit goods?</h3>
<p class="p1">Alibaba.com provides a very easy way for trademark owners to report and remove counterfeit listings.</p>
<p class="p1">But, since not all brands know about the issue, nor do all brands monitor Alibaba.com frequently, there are still many counterfeit goods available.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">To reduce your risk of importing and selling counterfeit goods unwittingly, try to avoid sourcing any branded goods on Alibaba.com.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">This is a particularly sensitive issue for luxury retailers. So, if you are looking to diversify within that space, it is recommended that you go through the luxury brand itself to ensure that you are acquiring the trademarked items in question.</p>
<p class="p1">Alibaba.com offers its own advice and best practices for avoiding fraudulent suppliers, below:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Fraudulent suppliers will sometimes offer unbelievably low prices, then ask you to pay through untraceable methods such as a Western Union or wire transfer. If such a case happens, you are advised to be cautious.</li>
<li class="p1">If a supplier places much attention on the payment process (they want to be paid quickly), please take extra care with all elements of the transaction. Generally, suppliers are just as careful as you are about fraud and they will take extra caution and time just to make sure they get your order correct before discussing payment.</li>
<li class="p1">Call the supplier’s telephone and fax numbers to verify your negotiations with them verbally. Bigcommerce addition: Skype can also be a great facilitator for this.</li>
<li class="p1">Be cautious if a supplier’s company name and personal name are identical, or if they use free email services such as Yahoo or Hotmail as their primary business email.</li>
<li class="p1">If you are still unsure of the supplier’s legitimacy, ask to pay for a sample to ensure the supplier’s product is able to meet all your expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>To answer the original question:</strong> yes, Alibaba is safe — if you take the right precautions.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Why are there significant price discrepancies between Alibaba products that look the exact same?</h3>
<p class="p1">On Alibaba.com, you will often find a huge range of pricing for a single product.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">The product was listed at a time when the cost for the item was higher. Now, the price has fallen and those listing the product are pricing it correctly as of current.</li>
<li class="p1">The quality for one of the items is better than for the other.</li>
<li class="p1">The company is a trading company rather than a manufacturer (more on this below).</li>
<li class="p1">The company with the higher price wants to earn a higher profit via their margins.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Many businesses looking to source from Alibaba.com assume the price differentiation is due to the latter option, leading them to choose the cheapest item.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">However, most successful products on Alibaba.com are copied by multiple manufacturers and trading companies in order to pull in more business.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">To do so, some of these suppliers may lower the product quality in order to maintain margins, but present a cheaper price.</p>
<p class="p1">In all, do your due diligence when sourcing your products and request samples. Business that are successful when sourcing from Alibaba.com often:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Reach out to more than 10 of the suppliers they are considering</li>
<li class="p1">Go with the one that is the easiest to work with, taking into account pricing and quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">What are Alibaba’s shipping costs, and why am I not receiving a response from the suppliers?</h3>
<p class="p1">It is wise to contact a supplier before finalizing a transaction.</p>
<p class="p1">Simply emailing them a letter of inquiry requesting a quote (yes, you can negotiate the posted price on the product page) and samples.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few good things to be sure to inquire about within your email:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Minimum Order Quantities</li>
<li class="p1">Pricing for Samples</li>
<li class="p1">Production Pricing</li>
<li class="p1">Production Time</li>
<li class="p1">Payment Terms</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Of course, not all suppliers will reply. In order to increase your response rate, be sure to keep your inquiry short and sweet.</p>
<p class="p1">The below sample email suffices for most situations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Hi,</p>
<p class="p1">I’m the ecommerce manager over at ABC company. I’m looking to place an order for Product A, but have a few questions for you before I do so. I’d appreciate your timely response on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What is your minimum order quantity?</li>
<li class="p1">What is your cost per unit and do you offer quantity discounts?</li>
<li class="p1">What are your payment terms for new customers?</li>
<li class="p1">How long is typical production time for a minimum order quantity of Product A?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Once I know this, I’ll be requesting a sample and will pass along my mailing address. Thank you so much and looking forward to doing business together.</p>
<p class="p1">Best,</p>
<p class="p1">Jane Smith</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The cost per unit questions should provide an answer for the cost of their samples, at which point you can ask to have them shipped to your address.</p>
<p class="p1">In all, if you do not receive a reply, don’t worry. Move on to the next supplier.</p>
<p class="p1">Alibaba.com also offers guidelines for increasing your supplier response rate, below.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that Alibaba.com is merely the platform that connects suppliers and buyers worldwide.</p>
<p class="p1">The company is not responsible for suppliers who do not respond to inquiries.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Write inquiries that are detailed and specific. This is to help suppliers better understand your sourcing requirements.</li>
<li class="p1">Check the “Sent Box” of your “Message Center” to confirm your inquiry has been sent. If your inquiry is not in the ‘Sent Box,’ we recommend re-sending your inquiry again.</li>
<li class="p1">Chat with suppliers in real-time using our instant messenger service, TradeManager. Click here to download TradeManager</li>
<li class="p1">Call or fax suppliers directly. Their contact information can be found in the ‘Contacts’ page of the Company Website.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">What is the estimated shipping time for my products?</h3>
<p class="p1">Shipping from Alibaba’s Chinese manufacturers can take a while depending on where you live. Expect in some cases to be waiting up to six weeks for your items.</p>
<p class="p1">For cost savings, many orders are shipped by boat to foreign buyers (which means if you are sourcing from an Asian manufacturer and you live in North America, your items will likely be shipped).</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to plan accordingly.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, if you are especially concerned with the timing issues related to shipping, you can always source your products from a closer manufacturer.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Alibaba.com is akin to the Yellow Pages for manufacturers, and not all of their suppliers are Asia-based.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">As the platform grows and more international customers begin to use the platform, sourcing options near you will incrementally add up.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What do I need to know when it comes to import duties and taxes, as well as customs clearance for the items I’m buying?</h3>
<p class="p1">A great way to handle customs when sourcing products internationally is to hire a customs broker like PCB.</p>
<p class="p1">At the very least, you can start reading some of the information they have on their site and find a customs broker that services your country.</p>
<p class="p1">Customs fees are a big variable that will depend on the product, the country of export and the country of import. A great solution to figure out customs is to use DutyCalculator.com.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Of course, many of the suppliers on Alibaba.com have U.S. warehouses.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If you choose such a supplier, the products themselves will be shipped directly to you and you can avoid import duties and customs clearance.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What’s the difference between a trading company and a manufacturer?</h3>
<p class="p1">A trading company often acts as a middleman between the buyer and the supplier.</p>
<p class="p1">For the most part, businesses prefer to buy straight from the manufacturer in order to cut costs.</p>
<p class="p1">Trading companies often price their products a bit higher in order to produce revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">The upside, however, is that trading companies can offer a larger variety of products, allowing a buyer to source from one supplier rather than multiple – as may be the case if a buyer chooses to buy solely from manufacturers.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a quick breakdown of how to tell trading companies from manufacturers:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>“Factory” means manufacturer on Alibaba.com</strong>. Trading companies buy from factories and then re-sell to profit from the price difference. Generally, buyers can get a better price buying from factories directly. Some trading companies unfortunately list themselves as factories, so, be aware. In general, if a company supplies an array of items, rather than a quality selection of a single category (i.e. if they supplied apparel versus if they supply sneakers –– the latter here is likely the actual factory).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ask to see a copy of a factory license.</strong> If you are unsure of whether or not your supplier is a trading company or a manufacturer, ask the manufacturer to supply the factory license. After all, you’re already requesting samples.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Don’t be so quick to judge.</strong> If you find a quality trading company via which you source multiple products without any problems, that’s great! The convenience of finding a good supplier and sourcing all or multiple of your products from them can be worth the extra spend.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Can I sell my Alibaba products on Amazon?</h3>
<p class="p1">Yes.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re planning on selling on Amazon (and depending on the size of your product) you can work with your manufacturer on ensuring it is in the right type of packaging (i.e. if clothing and apparel, a poly pack).</p>
<p class="p1">Again, many suppliers on Alibaba are excellent professionals and want to set you up for success.</p>
<p class="p1">So, if you have a question, just ask. Many are quite responsive.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Any tips for getting samples from Alibaba?</h3>
<p class="p1">In your first order, decide how much inventory you want and how to ship the items.</p>
<p class="p1">In your initial order, since you’re most likely testing concept, you may pay a bit extra to get the items shipped to you via air.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, this is OK. Focus more on getting your business live, testing, validating and then expanding your business.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Begin Your Alibaba Selling Journey</h2>
<p class="p1">In all, sourcing products and receiving shipments from Alibaba.com can be a groundbreaking opportunity for your ecommerce business to expand its product offering and ultimately scale into additional categories.</p>
<p class="p1">Its direct from supplier capabilities can also increase your margins and double your revenue, even if you don’t decide to source additional product categories.</p>
<p class="p1">As with all platform and technologies, however, you must do your due diligence.</p>
<p class="p1">Find suppliers, talk to them, build a network, earn trust and take your online business to the next level and grow safely with Alibaba.</p>

<p>I have a friend who runs a successful e-commerce business. He started off with just two small online stores a few years ago. When I asked him how he managed to climb so high in his trade, he responded saying that he was doing the exact same thing he was supposed to if he had opened a small flower shop near my house.</p>
<p>Now, you must be wondering &#8211; what does that have to with a flower shop?</p>
<p>Certainly, that wasn&#8217;t a clear answer and I really wanted to know the secret.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what he revealed.<span id="more-14347"></span></p>
<p>His secret was that he didn&#8217;t bother much focusing on the online status of his business. Instead, he was doing his best to satisfy the clients&#8217; demands and make them come back for more.</p>
<div>
<div class="click-to-tweet-wrap">Many online companies are so occupied bringing their websites to the top of Google search results that they forget their primary purpose- serving the clients.<span class="click-to-tweet-link-wrap">Click to Tweet </span></div>
</div>
<p>Internet marketing, online advertising, and search engine optimization are essential for any online business. But they always go hand in hand with the friendly user interface, flawless website operation, and a worry-free customer care.</p>
<p>Here is the list of the features you should incorporate into your e-commerce website design, to get loyal clients and make the most of your business.</p>
<h2>1) Customer names</h2>
<p>Do you know the most pleasant word we marketers like to use? You might think of &#8216;success&#8217;, or &#8216;trust&#8217;, or &#8216;conversions&#8217;, or &#8216;respect&#8217;, or something else. Well, the reality is it’s your name.</p>
<p>Psychologists say people love being addressed by their names. It has a strong correlation with the friendly nature of a person.</p>
<p>Marketers and sales managers understand this very well. Haven’t you ever been approached by a sales manager? The first thing he&#8217;d ask would be your name and it&#8217;s likely that it&#8217;ll be used multiple times in the conversation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14394" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design.png" alt="customer name" width="650" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-name_opt-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div class="click-to-tweet-wrap">Successful e-commerce websites use it as well. Personalization is the easiest way to make a customer feel special and important.<span class="click-to-tweet-link-wrap">Click to Tweet </span></div>
</div>
<p>If you allow personal account registration or support quick signup, make sure you ask a customer to enter the name. Here are the 3 reasons why you should certainly make one:</p>
<p>1) It’s quick. Compared with uploading pictures or entering other personal details it takes less time.<br />
2) It’s worry-free. For most people, this isn&#8217;t considered as sensitive information and they don&#8217;t mind sharing it.<br />
3) It’s efficient. You can use the name to personalize your clients’ dashboards and make them feel like home. This is something many e-commerce sites fail to do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14399" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-1.png" alt="ecommerce website design" width="650" height="338" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-1.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/name2_opt-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The main rule here is not to be obtrusive. Use customer names to greet them when they sign in after they make purchases or in email newsletters. Don’t put it in every second line on your website. We all dislike pushy shop assistants.</p>
<h2>2) Popular products</h2>
<p>It all starts with the shop window, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Before we enter a shop, we study what it has to offer. The same thing works for e-commerce websites. Don’t hesitate to add the best products to your main page.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14401" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-2.png" alt="popular products" width="650" height="340" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-2.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/popular-products_opt-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>You may call them popular, featured or bestsellers. They always attract a lot of attention and provide good conversions. These lists are often the most viewed on the e-commerce websites.</p>
<p>Many customers are too busy or sometimes even lazy to spend a lot of time searching for something. Put the best products on your homepage to help them make the right choice before they get frustrated and exit your store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14393" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-3.png" alt="bestsellers" width="650" height="370" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-3.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bestsellers_opt-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>To get the best results out of your favorites, monitor and update the lists regularly. A good idea is to share seasonal or monthly bestsellers.</p>
<h2>3) Product collections</h2>
<p>Product collections are the lists dedicated to a certain topic. They may be seasonal: winter or summer top products; festive: Christmas or New Year gifts, new arrivals, products with discounts or anything else that relates to your niche.</p>
<p>The best news is that they rank very well. This means you can climb much higher in the search results. Don&#8217;t forget to update and replace your collections from time to time. Customers are looking for something new every time they land on your site.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14400" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-4.png" alt="new arrivals" width="650" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-4.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/new-arrival_opt-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>A good way to make your collections more personal is to create a list of recommended items. Add the items based on what the last customer searches. People tend to buy similar products based on their taste and need.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14404" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-5.png" alt="recommended items" width="650" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-5.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shipping_opt-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h2>4) Zoom option</h2>
<p>If you have product pictures on your website (and it’s highly recommended to add them), make sure you&#8217;ve added a zoom option. Imagine you go to a shop to buy shoes. You’ll probably want to take a closer look at them. It’s all the same on the Internet.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t want to buy a pig in a poke. Regardless of what they buy- be it clothes, gadgets or cars, they want to see the details. Simply allow your clients to zoom in and zoom out pictures. Just make sure that the pictures have a good quality and do not get blurred.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14408" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-6.png" alt="zoom" width="650" height="498" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-6.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/zoom_opt-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Since it isn&#8217;t possible for customers to touch and hold products, you should provide a customer with as much visual information as possible.</p>
<h2>5) Shipping and delivery details</h2>
<p>If you offer shipping or delivery, make sure you added detailed information to your website. Place a link to this page at the top of the website.</p>
<p>Want a better idea? Here you go.</p>
<p>Add it to the main navigation menu or pin to the page header. This is very important, especially if you have different terms based on the location or on the order.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14405" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-7.png" alt="free shipping" width="650" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-7.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shippinh_opt-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Customers get frustrated when they find out that they can&#8217;t get a product they picked just because there&#8217;s no delivery to their location. If you offer free delivery, don&#8217;t hesitate to mention it on the main page.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14397" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-8.png" alt="free delivery" width="650" height="331" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-8.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/free-dlivery_opt-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>This is a good point to start your online advertising and an extremely attractive option that can bring you more customers.</p>
<h2>6) Contact details and feedback forms</h2>
<p>You probably want to build long-term relationships with your clients. To achieve this, you should make them trust you. Start with providing your contact information. Customers should know that they can reach out if they need to. Place this information somewhere where it can be easily accessed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14396" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-9.png" alt="feedback forms" width="650" height="290" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-9.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/feedback_opt-300x134.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>If you can afford an online chat, it’s perfect. Nothing makes a customer happier than a quick response. But if you can’t add it yet, don’t worry. You can start with a simple feedback form.</p>
<p>However, make sure that the submitted messages are not ignored and the estimated reply time is one working day or less.</p>
<h2>7) Ratings and reviews</h2>
<p>A successful e-commerce website is a kind of collaboration between the website owners, managers and the customers. It’s not just a shopping platform but, a community. Customers buy products, share their opinion with other people and give recommendations. We all know that the word of mouth often works better than any advertising.</p>
<p>Why not let it spread on your website?</p>
<p>Some website owners avoid adding the rating and comment features. They fear that customers will write negative reviews. Of course, a disappointed customer is much more motivated to write an angry review, than a satisfied customer. It’s time-consuming and you must have a good reason to spend your time writing a review.</p>
<p>If you don’t think you’re ready to add the comment and review features, start with the rating option. This is a win-win feature:</p>
<p>1) You can use the submitted rating to create handy filters;<br />
2) Customers can quickly pick the most rated (the best) products;<br />
3) It doesn’t take a lot of time to rate the product, so it demands less motivation.</p>
<p>But if you decide to go with the comments features, there are some ways to push the satisfied customers to writing reviews:</p>
<p>1) You can ask them directly in the follow-up email after the purchase;<br />
2) You can offer some perks to the most active users (e.g. discounts or bonuses)</p>

<p>All in all, a feedback from clients as important as a chance to get a feedback from you.</p>
<h2>8) Price filters</h2>
<p>Filters are an important part of any e-commerce website. But price filters are the most used and the most significant. Therefore, they need more attention.</p>
<p>Make sure your customers are able to sort and filter product by price in all product categories. If the price excludes the cost of delivery, don’t forget to include the information. If there are free or paid delivery based on the product, add a checkbox to hide or show products with the paid delivery.</p>
<p>Product pricing details must be transparent, without any hidden information.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14402" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-11.png" alt="pricing details" width="650" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-11.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/price-filters_opt-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Remember the more comfortable your users feel at your website, the more likely they are to find what they are looking for, buy it and then return or even bring some friends with them.</p>
<h2>9) Wishlists</h2>
<p>A wish list is an option designed for the customers who currently don’t have enough money to purchase a product or need more time to make a decision. Give them the opportunity to put a product aside and then get back to it when they are ready to buy.</p>
<p>People may forget what they wanted to purchase or simply find the same product on another website and buy it there. But if they have it on the wish list on your website, there is a greater chance they may buy it from you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14407" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-12.png" alt="wishlists" width="650" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-12.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wishlists_opt-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>You may later use gentle reminders to notify clients about price changes and push them to buy a product.</p>
<p>Tr to design a wish-list as eye-candy as possible. The better it looks, the more likely a customer is to move products to a cart.</p>
<h2>10) Sharing options</h2>
<p>Sharing is a powerful feature absent from many e-commerce website designs.</p>
<p>Allow your customers to share products with the nice and handy short links. You may integrate an online URL shortener with your website, many of them provide API. This feature may seem unnecessary to you, but don’t underestimate it.</p>
<p>Sharing products with one button that creates a short and eye-candy links is more attractive than copying bulky URLs. It’s especially important for smartphone and tablet users.</p>
<p>Some website owners prefer another way. They add the &#8216;Share on social media&#8217; buttons. This option has some advantages. Instead of copying a link to a clipboard, this feature allows sharing products instantly, without pasting links anywhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most customers prefer sharing products directly in personal messages, chats or via email.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14406" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-13.png" alt="sharing" width="650" height="326" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-elements-that-you-should-incorporate-into-your-ecommerce-website-design-13.png 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wishlist2_opt-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>You may decide to add both the above options. Just make sure your interface doesn’t look like a spaceship dashboard with hundreds of buttons.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>All e-сommerce websites are different. There is no ultimate interface solution. You should always think what your business needs in the first place.</p>
<p>But there are some must-have features you could use to get better results. Don’t forget to make them fit in your design.</p>
<p>The basic e-commerce UX rules are simple:</p>
<p>1) The design of your e-commerce website should be simple. All customers should feel comfortable. The navigation should be clear. All information should be easily accessible.<br />
2) You should provide detailed information about your products. Pictures, descriptions, zoom options. The more information customers get, the more likely they are to buy a product.<br />
3) Design a personal account page. Save last orders, allow to create wish-lists and save items in the cart for later. Clients like to have everything at hand.<br />
4) Add feedback and review forms. Give your clients a chance to reach out, ask questions and share feedback. This way you’ll make them feel more important.<br />
5) Add detailed information on delivery options. Don’t forget about website rules and terms of service. Describe methods of payment, shipping procedure, and returns policy. Protect yourself from arguments and claims.<br />
6) Make your website live and flourish. Add collections and lists, design a page with special offers and bonuses. Update your website regularly. Your customers will want to get back if they know something happens here<br />
7) And finally, never forget, that you deal with real people on the other side of the screen. Make them feel special.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these rules when you plan to add a new feature.</p>
<p>Think for a while.</p>
<p>Maybe, your website lacks a personal touch or, maybe, you forgot to add a feedback form. Many UX features are tiny and don’t require much time to design and add. But, your customers would be satisfied.</p>
<p>And the last recommendation. Ask your clients what they need. Sometimes, they may offer brilliant ideas that never crossed your mind.</p>

<p>If you thought that choosing the right product was more than enough, think again.</p>
<p>Photos define the product and show a potential customer a plethora of things &#8211; the uses for the product, the demographics of the people who use the product, the feelings associated with it, and of course, the perceived value of the product.</p>
<p>But, there’s more to this than meets the eye.<span id="more-14236"></span></p>
<p>Believe it or not, even the most effortless product photos require so much effort. This is because a product photo conveys so much more than the product itself.</p>
<p>Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder but in this case, you get to choose what your customers will see.</p>
<p>I welcome you to the wonderful world of product photography!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started with the basics.</p>
<h2><strong>How To Take Product Photos</strong></h2>
<p>Many fall into the trap of just ticking boxes in their quest to getting the best photos of their product taken. It takes more than this.</p>
<p>Carefully planning out the theme of your photo shoot or pictorial should be part of the process, and before you can do this, your branding has to be set straight. If your product photo is not passing along the message of your brand then you clearly have to take a step back and replan.</p>
<p>Make sure that the theme is in line with what your company, business or enterprise stands for because a properly executed photo shoot can be an extension of your whole company image.</p>
<p>You’ve heard the saying “cut once measure twice”? It’s the same concept here, shoot once plan twice. Photography is a business expense that can easily cost you a lot of money so proper planning will save you money in the long run.</p>
<h2><strong>The Message You Want To Convey</strong></h2>
<p>This all boils down to the personality you want your product to have. Yes, it&#8217;s as important as determining a price for your product.</p>
<p>Think about this for a while.</p>
<p>It’s called <em>product positioning</em>.</p>
<p>Do you want it to look like the best thing since sliced bread, or would you want it to be sophisticated and chic? Perhaps, you’d want the fun side of your offering presented?</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you want. But, what really matters is that you have it all planned out before you even start the photo shoot.</p>
<h2><strong>The Subject</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14241 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals.jpg" alt="product photography lighting technique" width="1920" height="1279" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-1867286_1920-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>There are plenty of ways for you to present your product photo.</p>
<p>One simple method involves displaying your offerings as a singular product in front of a white background. Do scale photographs to give the viewer a sense of the size of your offerings and you can use close-ups to highlight particular details.</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>Remember when we talked about the message that you want to convey with your photograph? This is where you can throw everything you know about the studio, out through that window.</p>
<p>Lifestyle shots are a great way to show your product in action.However, they might be trickier to do because you don’t control all the variables like a studio, but they really drive your brand image across.</p>
<p>Group shots are another way to present how your product integrates with the rest of the products in your portfolio. If you have different variations of the product i.e. different colors, or sizes, you’ll give the potential customer an easier time comparing.</p>
<p>Don’t forget the packaging too!</p>
<p>Great products are always presented well and that should be your goal. As much as a consumer is excited about the product itself, the packaging can make a difference. Remember how many YouTube channels rose to fame because of unboxing videos?</p>
<p><strong>So, are you ready?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have all the planning laid out, it’s time for us to start the photoshoot! The following steps are a quick guide for you to set everything up, it covers everything from your lighting to prep!</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Started: Prep</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure that you have more than one of the item you’re photographing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If something happens to it, it would be relieving to know that you have a backup.</p>
<p>Prep the item beforehand. Did you know that those food photos you see from restaurants aren’t real food most of the time?</p>
<p>Looking for that refreshing look? Get a spray gun and mist your product. (Not advisable for electronics mind you.) Want that “sizzle” effect? Get a vaporizer or a smoke machine and give it that mysterious air.</p>
<p>Want to have a little <em>more</em> fun?</p>
<p>Make your product levitate with a thin piece of string and get rid of the string during this stage.</p>
<p>Like we said, product photography is a great time for you to unleash your creativity on all cylinders!</p>
<h2><strong>The Perfect Camera?</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14238" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-1.jpg" alt="Camera lens" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-1.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nikon-1196116_1920-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>If you have the money, get the best camera that you can. At the end of the day, it’s a worthwhile investment especially if you’re planning to take a lot of photos or if you have a wide product inventory that you have to get on an ecommerce platform.</p>
<p>If you still can’t afford to invest in the best camera ever made then you can always borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>But, hold your horses.</p>
<p>If you are truly looking for the most affordable product photography options, don’t discount that little technological marvel in your pocket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14242" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-2.jpg" alt="iphone camera" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-2.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/smartphone-789625_1920-650x433.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes the hardware on your seemingly regular smartphone can do the trick, but make sure it takes clear photos!</p>
<p>So once you’ve got your camera, I have a few more tips to share with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aperture size matters, smaller apertures will keep your product in focus, wider ones will create a distortion effect. Don’t dismiss the distortion effect if you’re eyeing some creative shots though.</li>
<li>White balance has to be consistent with the product photography lighting set up (more on this later) that you have in the photo shoot location.</li>
<li>As per ISO, experiment with this because it&#8217;s dependent on your lighting needs. Remember, too much ISO results in noise in most cases.</li>
<li>Different lenses for different purposes. You don’t need a telescopic lens unless you’re photographing your product from a mile away. Don’t use macro lenses unless you’re selling something tiny.</li>
<li>Shutter speed affects light, so depending on how much exposure you need to adjust accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn’t it easier to use your phone sometimes?</p>
<h2><strong>A Tripod To Hold It Still</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14243" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-3.jpg" alt="tripod for camera" width="1513" height="1920" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-3.jpg 1513w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-236x300.jpg 236w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-768x975.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-807x1024.jpg 807w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manfrotto-tripod-2818673_1920-650x825.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1513px) 100vw, 1513px" /></p>
<p>If you are taking a photograph of a stationary object, your camera has to be stationary as well.</p>
<p>Why? Because movement creates blurriness and distortion.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of tripods available and at best guess, you will just need one of those regular ones that they sell in camera stores. You could get a fancier setup which would cost more, or a monopod if you plan on doing other things with it after the shoot, but a tripod should be enough for now.</p>
<p>A good tripod is also a sound investment like a camera; they last for years and they rarely go out of date.</p>
<p>Want to know the best part?</p>
<p>You can even use your tripod for personal purposes, think about all those professional looking photos you can take with your friends and family.</p>
<h2><strong>Product Photography Lighting Techniques</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14240" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-4.jpg" alt="photography studio" width="1920" height="1079" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-4.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/contemporary-1850469_1920-650x365.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>You have plenty of options for lighting but that doesn’t mean you should rush out and get yourself studio-grade lighting equipment. You can get yourself a lightbox, which can disperse light evenly and minimize shadows.</p>
<p>But before you pick your lighting options, find out what color your product is because of the fact that this greatly affects how everything works out. You can bounce cards from white foam, and even play with the reflections and shadows to create your desired effects.</p>
<p>The opportunities are endless.</p>
<p>But, wait.</p>
<p>How about if you want to use natural light coming in from the windows? You can do that too! The trick is to control the natural light coming in from the window; you don’t want it to be too one-sided to any degree. So, use bounce boards if necessary.</p>
<p>Quick advice?</p>
<p>Make sure you always have two sources of light. Well, if you don’t, a pair of bright bulbs – the cool 5000K kind will usually do the trick.</p>
<p>Remember, that lighting can be tricky and dependent on a number of factors that are not directly related to lightning per se. For example, the aperture of the camera plays a vital role in how much exposure your product photograph gets in general.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about white balance and ISO filters, these play such a crucial role in the exposure of your photograph.</p>
<p>More importantly, don&#8217;t be afraid of shadows. In a perfect environment, you would want to eliminate them altogether, but it can also be a creative way to “frame” your photo.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Background</strong></h2>
<p>Product photographs usually utilize white backgrounds. Again, as we’ve repeated time and time again, if you have the money and are going to do this often, it’s better to invest in something great.</p>
<p>White sweeps can be bought online, or if you’re on a tight budget, you can always use poster board or cardboard, and sometimes even a sheet.</p>
<p>But, here’s the caveat:</p>
<p>Remember that the color that you see now has a chance to look different in photographs. This is especially the case with poster boards.</p>
<p>Off-white as opposed to pure white really looks different when you start “framing” your product.</p>
<p>What kind of sweep should you get? It really depends on you. Paper sweep is a good choice because it’s cost effective since you can always get rid of the dirty areas. Also, make sure that the white background is seamless.</p>
<h2><strong>The Extras</strong></h2>
<p>There are a few other things that you will need in order to set up the product photo shoot. Make sure you have a table in order for you to have a place to put the products on.</p>
<p>Make sure you have some tape ready to get everything in order and have someone around to help you out, should the need arise.</p>
<h2><strong>The Checklist: How to Take Product Photos</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14239" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-5.jpg" alt="camera equipment" width="1920" height="1361" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/product-photography-lighting-guide-a-secret-technique-to-produce-stunning-visuals-5.jpg 1920w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-300x213.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-768x544.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/camera-1701049_1920-650x461.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Get your table in order; this means getting your product in place and making sure you’ve got everything you need.</li>
<li>Set your camera with the product in focus.</li>
<li>Double check the background, is there anything that will mess up the photo to begin with? Everything in the background has to be clean.</li>
<li>Get your light right. It helps if you have a hand with the bounce cards at this point.</li>
<li>Using the tips that we gave you adjust your camera as necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>and here&#8217;s more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the shutter</li>
<li>It’s probably going to be a bad photo.</li>
<li>So, readjust and hit that button again, and take as many photos as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations, you now have a product photo! And now, let&#8217;s move onto touching up.</p>
<h2><strong>Touching Up</strong></h2>
<p>There are plenty of post-processing programs that you can use like Adobe Lightroom (or VSCOCam if you did plan on post-processing on your phone). They offer you many benefits; they can alter lighting and change the mood with a flick of the switch.</p>
<p>Always look for ways to enhance your photo with minimal effort. You don’t want to end up with something that looks completely natural. If you nailed down most of the steps above, then you shouldn’t even be spending too much time with post-processing.</p>
<p>Want a better way to do this?</p>
<p>Get your photos touched up by a professional.</p>
<p>You would be surprised at how affordable it’ll be to just send the photos to a professional.</p>
<p>Some would even only charge you roughly $4 per photograph that you submit for a professional touch up.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>The bottom line is that you won’t be able to get everything down on your first “click”, but that’s all part of the process. Give it just a little time.</p>
<p>You can hire professionals to take the photographs for you, but that will cost you time and money.</p>
<p>However, if you decide to take that route, I hope that this article will give you the basics of painting the theme that you want them to capture.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it takes a lot of photos and preparation to even score one perfect photograph to be used commercially. Let your enthusiasm and creativity get the best of you.</p>
<p>Product photography lighting is a crucial skill to learn and you can always apply it to future products that you release.</p>
<p>It certainly is a win-win situation.</p>

<p class="p1">Consumers seek time-saving shortcuts all the time, and their attention naturally gravitates to the quickest way to gather information: images.</p>
<p class="p1">Product images not only testify to the quality of your product, but also serve as windowfs into your ecommerce store, creating 2 very important things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Transparency</li>
<li class="p1">Trust</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">When consumers view a product page, they are looking for proof of quality and value.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Images shape their first impression, creating a tipping point as to whether they will continue browsing and eventually make a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Here, we’ll show you how to take images that:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Engage</li>
<li class="p1">Convert</li>
<li class="p1">Boost the lifetime value of your customers.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">We’ll also go over how to optimize the photo creation process to save you time and money.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that you don’t need a large budget to create polished and professional product photos.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>In fact, we will show you how to do it for about $50.</strong></p>
<h2 class="p3">What is Product Photography?</h2>
<p class="p1">Product photography uses specific techniques to showcases products in an attractive way and entice potential buyers to purchase specific products.</p>
<p class="p1">Product photography is an essential part of both online and offline advertising for successful catalogues, brochures, magazine ads, billboards, online ads and company websites, specifically when selling products direct to consumer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26871 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-22.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="387" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-22.jpg 581w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ecommerce-product-photography-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s take a closer look at why images are so important.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why Photography Increases Conversions</h2>
<p class="p1">90% of information transmitted to our brain is visual.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">No matter how sophisticated, website visitors are first engaged by visual elements, not written copy.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Photos are a key part of a consumer&#8217;s decision-making process, ultimately determining conversion and retention rates.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The quality of a product photo reflects your brand image, creating the infamous first impression.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The key to making the most of their first impress is to present polished, professional images that evokes maximum engagement.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Quality visuals enhance every buyer touchpoint.<span class="s1"><br /> </span></h3>
<p class="p1">93% of consumers consider images essential in purchasing decisions.</p>
<p class="p1">Your images represent your product’s perceived value and quality. They speak directly to your target audience, making your product page and content more relatable.</p>
<p class="p1">Take Naturally Curly’s for example.</p>
<p class="p1">They offer amazing images of simple, everyday products, often making them cool and appealing.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at the product images below. How neat and trustworthy do they look?</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26864 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-23.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="319" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-23.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-1-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Naturally Curly</em></p>
<p class="p1">Again, you don’t need a large budget to create polished and professional product photos. In this guide, we’ll show you how to do it for $50.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Images are a key element of branding.</h3>
<p class="p1">Branding should be central to every decision your company makes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your social media posts</li>
<li class="p1">Website updates</li>
<li class="p1">All your marketing efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">And images are at the helm of your brand. They are the first to grab attention, instill trust, and invite customers to take a further look.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Everything in an image<span class="s2">—</span>quality, subject matter, color theme and saturation<span class="s2">—</span>should speak in a uniform voice that resonates with your target audience.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Your goal is to form long-term relationships with your customers, and photos are one of the most important tools to achieve that.</p>
<p class="p1">Seriously Silly Socks does a great job at this. They offer polished but super brand-charged product-only images.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26863 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-24.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="300" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-24.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-2-300x120.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Seriously Silly Socks</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">The 2 Types of Ecommerce Product Photography</h2>
<p class="p1">There are two main types of images that should be used on your product page and across your marketing channels.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><strong>The first are clean-cut, white background, product-only images.</strong> These should include your featured product, and a variety of images showcasing your product from different angles. Below is an example of Sierra Designs’ product-only shot.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-26862 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-25.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="325" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-25.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-3-300x130.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The second is in-context or lifestyle photos</strong> that show your product being used in its intended environment or alongside complementing products.<em> </em>Here’s the same product in a lifestyle or in-context shot.<em><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26865 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-26.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="391" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-26.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-4-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-4-1-1596x834.jpg 1596w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-4-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></em></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4">Product-Only Images.</h3>
<p class="p1">Product-only images are meant to show your product in its best light from all relevant angles.</p>
<p class="p1">They are usually shot on a white background, helping to create a consistent look across your product line.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">These images describe your product at a glance and are best suited for your product page. Their job is to nurture page visitors towards making a purchase.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Contrary to what people might assume, you actually need about a dozen images on your product page, not just one or two.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of them should be product-only shots, with one or two in-context shots mixed in, designed to create further emotional bonds with your product.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Product-only images are generally the most suited for product pages, as they have a significantly higher rate of conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="p4">In-Context Images.</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26860 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-27.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="327" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-27.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-5-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Dainty Jewells</em></p>
<p class="p1">Lifestyle shots, ones that tell a story, are best suited for social media, blog posts, emails, and other marketing channels at the top of your conversion funnel.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It’s also good to add a few in-context snaps to your product page, helping to to boost emotional engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">The same rules apply to taking lifestyle photos as in product-only shots, apart from the fact that lifestyle photos allow you a lot more creative freedom.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use a camera, with or without a tripod, or why not take your products photos outdoors, to a settings that suits your brand’s voice.</p>
<p class="p1">For outdoor shoots on a budget, it is best to use natural light.</p>
<p class="p1">You can achieve really beautiful results if you shoot early in the morning or in the late afternoon, when the light is filtered at a smaller angle.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Basic Product Photography Equipment and Process</h2>
<p class="p1">For those new to photography, your first product shoot may seem overwhelming.</p>
<p class="p1">But after a few rounds, each step will become more natural, and you won’t even have to think about it.</p>
<p class="p1">The key is to find a process that suits your needs, optimize it, and create a set of guidelines to ensure you keep your images consistent.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at our DIY product photography tips.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Set up your background and product.<span class="s1"><br /> </span></h3>
<p class="p1">Getting the right background is worth the effort, because it simplifies the entire editing process.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Use a white or light backdrop, as it’s easy to remove when retouching your images.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">There are lots of ways you can improvise a background on a budget, and we will look at two that can be set up for under $20.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">A shooting table: You can create this with a chair you have in your home or office.</li>
<li class="p1">A light tent</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p6">Shooting Table.</h4>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26859 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-28.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-28.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-6-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">The first is a chair mounted sweep. For this, all you need is a roll of craft paper.</p>
<p class="p1">The simplest way to achieve this is by pushing a chair against a wall, and taping craft paper on the wall allowing it naturally fall to the ground, creating a seamless transition between the vertical to horizontal plane.</p>
<p class="p1">Or you can clip the paper to the top of the chair to improvise a stand for your sweep like the image above.</p>
<h4 class="p6">Light Tent.</h4>
<p class="p1">The other budget approach is to create your own lightbox, aka light tent.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">A light tent is a box-shaped device with translucent walls, designed to help distribute the light evenly around the object of photography.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Here’s how to set one up.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">To get started, you need a plastic storage container that you can put on its side with the lid off.</li>
<li class="p1">Then, tape some white paper to the bottom, and you can also tape white paper or cloth on the sides to serve as diffusers, which helps to distribute the light better, minimizing unnecessary shadows.</li>
<li class="p1">Depending on your budget, you can use artificial lighting and place them either side of the container, or for those on a budget take advantage of natural lighting by placing it your DIY lightbox next to a large window.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p6">Setting up your Product.</h4>
<p class="p1">It’s important to make sure you set your product up in front of your background on a flat, stable surface.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you get the lighting right, you’re almost ready to shoot.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re shooting jewelry, it’s always best to use a bust. Those on a budget can improvise by making one from a piece of cardboard, like in the image below.</p>

<p class="p1">You can also use fishing line to suspend earrings and other small items, which is easily removed in the editing process.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas for harder to photograph items:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Use glue dots and tape to fix small items in place.</li>
<li class="p1">For clothing, it’s always best to use a mannequin, which can be easily removed.</li>
<li class="p1">You could try experimenting with a hanger or even creative flatlay.</li>
<li class="p1">For lifestyle shots, why not ask a friend or team member to sport your clothes for some bonus photos.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">If you are shooting large items, like furniture, you will need a stand mounted sweep that might cost a little more.</p>
<p class="p1">But you can improvise by getting a few rolls of craft paper, taping them to the wall, and letting gravity do all the work.</p>
<p class="p1">This technique follows the same principles as the table mounted sweep, only it’s a bit bigger.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Get your lighting right.</h3>
<p class="p1">If there is one deciding factor that defines the quality of your images, it’s light.</p>
<p class="p1">Lighting can be very tedious to set up, but when done right, it brings beautiful results and significantly simplifies your post-processing.</p>
<p class="p1">You have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Natural Light:</strong> Best if you’ve created a chair mounted sweep.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Studio Light:</strong> Best if you have the budget, or if you create a lightbox.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p6">Natural Light.</h4>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26856 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-31.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-31.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-9-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-9.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">When you’re on a budget, you should use natural light. It’s much easier to manipulate, and, for small in-house product shoots, it can save you lots of time and hassle.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Start by placing your shooting table near a large window, ideally one that allows lots of light into the room.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">If the light is too harsh, you can diffuse it by placing a cloth or white paper over the window (see image above).</p>
<p class="p1">If the shadows are too harsh, use white plasterboard or cardboard on either side of the object, helping to reflect some light and soften it. It’s always best to shoot when the day is at its brightest, giving you more light to play with.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26855 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-32.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="375" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-32.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-10-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">Better to have too much sunlight and minimise it, than not enough.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s very hard to create great lighting during the editing process.</p>
<p class="p1">But keep in mind never to shoot under direct sunlight. Just like a strong backlight, direct light can create harsh shadows.</p>
<h4 class="p6">Studio Lights.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26854 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-33.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="450" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-33.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-11-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: arqspin</em></p>
<p class="p1">If you have to use artificial lighting, you will need at least two softbox light setups to get the shadows right.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">You can typically buy two clip-on light clamps, with strong bulbs for under $30. If your budget is slightly higher, you can get two softbox setups for about $50.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">One of the lights should serve as your key light, and the other as your fill light or backlight, depending on your desired results.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider placing some white paper or cloth over them to diffuse some of the light, helping to achieve softer shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">Your key light should be placed in front <span class="s2">— </span>often slightly to the side <span class="s2">— </span>of the product, while your fill or backlight is on the opposite side, back or above.</p>
<p class="p1">Manipulate the angles and distance of the lights until you get soft, evenly distributed shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also use white plasterboard or cardboard to defuse some of the light and further soften those shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This is what lightboxes are designed to do; they are a diffuser of sorts, distributing the light evenly around the product.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">With that in mind, studio lights give you more control over the entire process, especially if you are shooting multiple products over several hours.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have the right setup, you can get consistent, professional results and recreate them for all your shoots.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Use a tripod.</h3>
<p class="p1">Tripods bring consistency, stability, and focus.</p>
<p class="p1">It is easy to end up with blurry images when you try to get your entire product in focus, while holding your camera in your hand without moving.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">If you can’t fit a tripod into your budget, use a pile of books or a stool to keep your camera fixed.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">A decent tripod will serve you well for many years, and you should be able to get one for under $30. It’s definitely worth picking on up when you have some budget.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re using a camera, set it to a low aperture (AKA a high f/stop), and slow shutter speed.</p>
<p class="p1">That way you will get a wide depth of field, keeping your entire product in focus, leaving your products looking crisp.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s vital to stabilize your camera when you are shooting with a wide depth of field in order to avoid blurry images.</p>
<h3 class="p4">4. Pick the right camera.</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26853 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-34.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="400" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-34.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-12-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: Pixc</em></p>
<p class="p1">It is the most essential element to any product photography shoot: a camera.</p>
<p class="p1">Prices of DSLR and point and shoot cameras have steadily dropped over recent years.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<h6 class="snippet">Recommended DSLR Settings for Product Photography:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use a wide angle lens. You will distort your product.</li>
<li>Use the right aperture for the right shot. A wide aperture like f2.8 or f4.5 will narrow your depth of field, leaving parts of your product out of focus. A small aperture like f8 or f11 will give you a wider depth of field, keeping your entire product crisp and in focus.</li>
<li>Use the correct white balance. When shooting, you should set it to the same Kelvin temperature as your lights.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">However, if you have a smartphone, you don’t need to worry about investing in a camera when you’re getting starting.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Smartphone camera technology has come a long way and sometimes you can take even better pictures than you might using a professional camera.</p>
<p class="p1">So as long as you get your lighting and background right, your iPhone or Samsung device can do a good job.</p>
<p class="p1">You might want to get a smartphone stabilizer or tripod, like Joby, at some point to help reduce blur and speed up post-processing.</p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Don’t forget post-processing.</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26852 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-35.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="447" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-master-product-photography-on-a-tight-budget-we-did-it-with-less-than-50-35.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ecommerce-product-photography-13-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p class="p1">Retouching your images after the shoot is vital to achieving a polished look.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Even if you shoot your product with a smartphone, editing can be the difference between mediocre and professional results.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">For those starting out, getting the background or the lighting right takes a bit of trial and error. Thankfully photo editing can make a multitude of flaws magically disappear.</p>
<p class="p1">Retouching covers anything from background removal to color correction, mannequin removal, and shadow addition for a more natural look.</p>
<p class="p1">Photo editing is a time-consuming process, especially until you get the hang of things.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Luckily, there’s a world of free image editing tools available to help with all your photo editing needs.</p>

<h2 class="p3">How to Create Product Photography Guidelines</h2>
<p class="p1">Once you have the process down to a fine art, make sure you take the time to create clear shooting, brand, and editing guidelines so you can maintain consistency as your business grows.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">This step won’t cost anything, apart from the time it takes you to write it down!</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Make sure you document all the minor things, including things like the distance between the camera and product, angles, and lighting setup.</p>
<p class="p1">Trust me, it’s worth the effort in the long run.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that your product photos are basically brand ambassadors, and maintaining consistency is crucial.</p>
<p class="p1">Create a technical guide and a template in your editing software that will help you maintain consistent size and scale.</p>
<p class="p1">Go a step further and create a style guide for your in-context snaps too.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure you include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Color Palette</li>
<li class="p1">Saturation</li>
<li class="p1">Focal Length</li>
<li class="p1">Shadows</li>
<li class="p1">Composition</li>
<li class="p1">Location and Context</li>
<li class="p1">Consistency</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Share your guide with everyone involved in your product shoots, and post a copy in your in-house studio for quick reference.</p>
<p class="p1">Having an image guide will not only save you money in the long run, but also save you lots of time as you won’t have to repeat the training processes.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you can focus on more profitable tasks, such as growing your business.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Optimizing Your Images (and Increasing SEO)</h2>

<p class="p1">Make sure you implement free minifying tools to optimize your images, and shave off a few unnecessary kilobytes.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, always make sure you name your images correctly, including as much relevant metadata and keywords as possible.</p>

<p>Google just announced that beginning summer of 2018, mobile page load speed will be a ranking factor for mobile search results.</p>
<p>That means that your site needs to load fast – officially – or no one will be able to find it.</p>
<p>To account for this, <span class="s1">BigCommerce has integrated Akamai Image Manager into the Stencil theme platform. This integration delivers lighter, faster images at the highest visual quality by optimizing each online image for device type, image quality and download size. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Improvements to customer engagement from faster loading images has been shown to improve conversion by up to 19% and cut image prep time by 25% in Akamai’s studies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our own BigCommerce study has found enabling Image Manager can improve page load speed by up to 70% in a closed beta in Q3 2017.</span></p>

</ol>
<h3 class="p1">Should I invest in professional product photography?</h3>
<p class="p2">If you can afford it, yes.</p>
<p class="p2">Photos of your product both by themselves and in use are some of the most important merchandising and marketing efforts you do for your online brand.</p>
<p class="p2">Because consumers cannot touch or see your product in person, your product photography must do the trick.</p>
<p class="p2">If you can, hire a professional. If you can’t, this guide will walk you through how to bootstrap it for the time being.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How much does a product photographer cost?</h3>
<p class="p2">Product photography rates range from $7 a photo to $50 for setup and $25/hour – or more.</p>
<p class="p2">You’ll need to work with various photographers to get the pricing model right for your needs and your type of products.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p2">For instance, if you have a large catalog –– $7 per photo probably isn’t reasonable and you’d be better off with an hourly range. If you only have a few products, you’re likely better off with an hourly rate.</p>

<p>Your business is <em>alive and kicking</em>.</p>
<p>Just like how your business has a life cycle, so do your customers. They are continuously interacting with the goods and services that you offer. This phenomenon is often referred to as the <em>customer lifecycle.</em></p>
<p>To put it into quick perspective, there are different ways to get a potential customer to consider your offering and then ensure that they’ll come back for more <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<p>Want to know the secret art? Read on.<br />
<span id="more-14268"></span></p>
<p>It might appear to be difficult when you come to know about it but it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ll explain how it really works but before we proceed, you&#8217;ll need to be able to identify the different phases a customer goes through.</p>
<h2><strong>The Stages of The Customer Life Cycle</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing to understand before you can start luring customers is the intrinsic value of the customer lifecycle.</p>
<p>Life is synonymous with business; both have different stages.</p>
<p>Namely, this process is broken into these main steps: your reach, acquisition, development and nurturing, retaining them, and creating an advocacy.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t just about making them come back for more. For you to understand the technique, you need to look at those in context.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reach</strong> – this refers to how you can get your offerings in front of your customer. Think advertising, promotion, and outreach.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong> – getting them to pay for your good or service.</li>
<li><strong>Development and nurturing</strong> – maintaining the relationship with them. If you already got them to buy once, you can always get them to do it again.</li>
<li><strong>Retention</strong> – keeping your customers close, very close.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy</strong> – pretty much, getting to love you so much that they’ll spread the word.</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are important in developing your customer relationship management (CRM) along with the customer lifecycle.</p>
<h2><strong>Increasing Customer Life Cycle Value</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we have it all hammered down, let’s take a look at how we can increase the customer lifecycle and turn clients into clientele.</p>
<p>The most important part of increasing customer lifecycle value is the relationship that you have with your customer after the sale. For most entrepreneurs, this is probably going to be the best part.</p>
<p>And, it gets better:</p>
<p>Getting this right usually results in more business for your enterprise. Take a step back and think about this for a little while. What’s better- a single sale over one period <em>or</em> repeat sales from a particular customer?</p>
<p>In theory, repeat sales cost less money to procure and open the doors to even more opportunities in the future. (I&#8217;ll discuss this later)</p>
<h2><strong>An Impeccable After Sales Experience</strong></h2>
<p>Ever loved an almost perfect service only for your feelings towards it to change after speaking to annoying tech support reps who only care about logging in their hours?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there.</p>
<p>You may have the perfect product and service but, if your after sales experience sucks, they’re not going to come back for more.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have proper procedures in place to handle the after sales aspect of the actual sale. This includes having a good team that can handle any concerns, having a proper feedback system, and <em>follow up.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just follow up if they have a complaint. If they do have a complaint, you should get very personal with them in your connection. Check out Pizza Hut&#8217;s example: an apology letter sent to this woman.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14277" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers.png" alt="Pizaa hut customer relations" width="922" height="540" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers.png 922w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-4.08.28-PM-300x176.png 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-4.08.28-PM-768x450.png 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-4.08.28-PM-650x381.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /></p>
<p>You might be thinking of follow up as a way to generate sales off the bat, but trust me, customers usually know when you’re attempting an upsell almost immediately after the sale.</p>
<p>Instead of offering them an add-on, ask them how they feel about a product and how you can help them with your offering. Every interaction with them has to show that you care about them more than your profits.</p>
<p>Believe me, it’s not that hard to implement and certainly begs the question &#8211; &#8216;How to do it?&#8217;</p>
<p>Well, here are some very useful ways.</p>
<h3><strong>Offer More Than What They’ve Asked For</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that it takes more than five times the resources to make a new sale than retain a new one? So if you’re already spending money then you should offer more!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about giving away your stock, but rather about <em>adding value </em>to the value that they’re purchasing.</p>
<p>An extended warranty, semi-preferential treatment, special packaging, special rates, free shipping, no delivery charge, as long as it’s making them feel special, they’ll want to get that feeling from you.</p>
<p>Plus:</p>
<p>They’ll associate that particular feeling with your products allowing you to develop your brand even more.</p>
<p>Check out this Redditor who talks about how Dell values warranties on their products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14270" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-1.png" alt="Dell customer service" width="602" height="108" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-1.png 602w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-18-at-11.56.12-PM-300x54.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>After talking to their customer they decided to actually send a real person over and not even let the customer spend a single penny!</p>
<h3><strong>Bond With Your Customer</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right. One of the ways that you can positively increase the customer lifecycle is to bond with your customer. Create meaningful interactions if you can and create real avenues for conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media is a good tool. Use it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14273 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-2.png" alt="Redbull prolonging customer lifecycle" width="601" height="479" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-2.png 601w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-3.42.11-PM-300x239.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you just love this? Red Bull, one of the biggest beverage companies in the world with a roster of famous people that we love, freely interacts with their customers. Social media can easily bridge the divide if customers perceive you to be too corporate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide feedback on your end with regard to how others use the offerings that they have purchased.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14269" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-3.png" alt="Grammarly email" width="557" height="246" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-3.png 557w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-2.49.20-PM-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></p>
<p>Check out how Grammarly&#8217;s emails aren&#8217;t really annoying and make for a very casual read. In fact, you feel great about using their services and they can even encourage you to write some more! (Whilst, indirectly telling you they&#8217;re helping you!)</p>
<p>They create this collaborative feeling between you and their company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send emails to them on special days with special offers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to them and ask them how they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>But:</p>
<p>Don’t be annoying.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand Your Customer</strong></h3>
<p>If you think you’ve nailed the three most important precepts of customer retention. Then, you’re ready for more.</p>
<p>Customers’ needs are very dynamic, as a result of this, you also have to be as dynamic with your offerings.</p>
<p>This goes beyond the usual surveys or customer feedback that we’re all used to. Study their purchasing behavior and see how you can improve your products to match demand. Find out what makes them tick and adapt to that, it will all be worth it in the long run.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Check out what Starbucks used to do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14275" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-4.png" alt="My Starbucks Idea" width="318" height="445" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-4.png 318w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-3.48.37-PM-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></p>
<p>Although they have now moved this to their main Twitter page, it still serves as a good example of a company reaching out to their customers and asking them to get involved!</p>
<h2><strong>Tools to Help You Nurture Lifecycle</strong></h2>
<p>If you own a company then you should pay attention to your customer relationship management.</p>
<p>There are probably a hundred different CRM software choices available for you out there and you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems picking one out of the pack.</p>
<p>Pick one that allows you to funnel your customers in their different stages of the lifecycle.</p>
<p>However, realize one thing, most CRM software solutions are concentrated on sealing the deal. Look for one that helps you keep a connection going with your customer even after the initial sale.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to nurture the relationship, not the sale itself.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Them to Stay Loyal</strong></h2>
<p>The customer life cycle is just like any relationship that you’ll have with a person. With that being said, it’s important to note that loyalty plays an important role in getting them to stay with you.</p>
<p>But, it’s not your customers that need to be loyal to your brand or offering. You have to make sure that you’re loyal to them as well.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to sound like your spouse, but loyalty is a two-way stream. As I&#8217;ve discussed earlier, you need to nurture the business relationship that you have with your customer.</p>
<p>Build an advocacy with your customers. Trust me, you&#8217;ll reap the benefits soon enough.</p>
<p>Customers will start talking about you and that&#8217;s when you realize that you&#8217;ve done a great job.</p>
<p>For instance, look at this random Buffer user. Check out the personalized reply from Buffer after the customer advocated their product.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14276" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-5.png" alt="Buffer Reply" width="625" height="557" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/customer-lifecycle-guide-develop-perfect-understanding-with-your-customers-5.png 625w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-20-at-3.55.07-PM-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>By the way, if you&#8217;re having a social management debacle with regard to nurturing the customer lifecycle, you can use their service. You see the effect? Even we like them for some reason!</p>
<p>They nail it perfectly. They offered a great service that made users advocate for them, they tend to be personal with their users and that establishes a connection, and they can be sure that this user will keep coming back.</p>
<p>This is the <em>bottom line</em>:</p>
<p>If you take care of them, they&#8217;ll take care of you, because they&#8217;re only human too.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this article has provided enough insight to help you develop and nurture the most important values of your customer lifecycle.</p>
<p>At the end, all you got to do is care about them as if they were family.</p>
