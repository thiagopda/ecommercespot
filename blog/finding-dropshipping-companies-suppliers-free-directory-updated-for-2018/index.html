<p>Are you looking to start an ecommerce business without the need to stock inventory yourself?</p>
<p>Or are you wanting to expand your existing business by offering more products?</p>
<p>Dropshipping may be the way to go.</p>
<h2>What is Dropshipping?</h2>
<p>Dropshipping allows you to partner with a supplier to display their products in your store. In other words, you can sell their goods. </p>
<p>The supplier retains each product in their own warehouse until the item is ordered.</p>
<p>When an item is ordered from your site, the supplier will then ship the product directly to your customer.</p>
<p>The product itself never passes through your hands.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26507" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/finding-dropshipping-companies-suppliers-free-directory-updated-for-2018-1.png" alt="dropship suppliers" width="420" height="320" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dropship-suppliers.png 420w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dropship-suppliers-300x229.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></p>
<p>Dropshipping can be a convenient way to offer your customers more products or to launch your own business. </p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a reason why not everyone is getting in on the action.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth of it: it can be difficult to find a reputable, affordable dropshipping supplier in your business niche.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p>Many dropshippers are tiny companies without much marketing power, meaning they barely show up in Google search results. That makes them incredibly difficult to find with a simple Google search.</p>
<p>Others may turn out to be a scam just trying to swindle you with an exorbitant sign-up fee.</p>
<p>There are other options too – like turning to general, more well-known dropshipping marketplaces like Alibaba or Salehoo, which grant you access to many suppliers at once. These, however, often come with a yearly fee.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p>Between scams, fees and just plain difficult to find suppliers – using dropshipping to launch or expand your business is often cumbersome, and expensive in both time and cash.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p>That is why we&#8217;ve put together this guide. </p>
<p>We’ve compiled a list of both general and niche dropshipping companies, many of which charge only for the cost of the item and shipping.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended">

<h2><strong>FAQs About Dropshipping Suppliers</strong></h2>
<h3>What is the Dropshipping supply chain?</h3>
<p>The dropshipping supply chain is often long and tedious.</p>
<p>First, the product is produced at the manufacturing level – at which point it’s at its cheapest).</p>
<p>Then, the product is stocked by an initial wholesaler, who typically marks up the price of the product before making it available for dropshipping.</p>
<p>At this point the product is often transferred to an additional wholesaler, who may mark up the price even further or act if as they’ve received it directly from the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Beware of this</strong>, as the price of the item may now be so high that you won’t make much profit by trying to dropship it.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p>Warning signs of a fake or additional wholesaler include a spammy looking website, no requirement for a dropshipping application, or a part of the website that sells directly to the public.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p>Next the product is purchased and stocked by you, the wholesaler, before reaching its final destination: the end consumer.</p>
<h3>Are there free dropshippers with no membership fees?</h3>
<p>There are many free dropshippers in both general and niche categories.</p>
<p>Though some larger dropshippers charge yearly or monthly fees, most only ask that you pay the cost of the products you’re shipping to the customer.</p>
<p>Some charge additional shipping costs or fees.</p>
<h3>What are some examples of free dropshippers?</h3>
<p>There are many dropshippers across all niches that offer dropshipping with no sign-up fees or monthly services, such as the ones listed below.</p>
<p>Before signing up for an account with a supplier it’s always best to contact them and confirm their pricing policies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nordstrom (Clothes, Shoes, Jewelry, Home Decor).</li>
<li>Pout in Pink (Children and Infant Boutique Clothing).</li>
<li>COOKOO (Smart watches).</li>
<li>Koehler Home Decor (Home decor and furniture).</li>
<li>Aulola (Toys and Electronic Accessories).</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do dropship suppliers handle returns?</h3>
<p>To return an item you’ll often need to get a return merchandise authorization, or RMA, from your supplier, which aids the process of your customer shipping the product back to their address.</p>
<p>Make sure you also have all other item information on hand to help the process go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>Once the item is shipped and received the supplier refunds you and you refund the customer.</p>
<p>Beware of extra fees from your dropshipper, like a restocking fee.</p>
<h3>Are there any dropshipping legal issues to be aware of?</h3>
<p>Before you begin dropshipping, familiarize yourself with counterfeit and trademark regulations in your region to ensure that you and your dropshipping supplier avoid crossing any lines, especially with branded products like Apple phones.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to create a written dropshipping contract with your supplier that specifies all terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>Can I dropship on Amazon?</h3>
<p>You can dropship on Amazon, though you must first apply for an Amazon seller account and be approved as a dropshipper.</p>
<p>Amazon restricts dropshippers to selling through their Fulfillment By Amazon program (FBA) and prohibits shipping products with packing slips or information other than your own.</p>
<p>View more on their dropshipping policies here.</p>
<h3>Can I dropship on eBay?</h3>
<p>You can also drop ship on eBay.</p>
<p>However, on this platform you’re often competing with sellers who mark down their products to unreacheable depths, such as direct manufacturers or sellers from international regions.</p>
<p>Because eBay is focused on the product with the cheapest price, it’s hard to make much of a profit margin dropshipping items here.</p>
<h3>Can I dropship on Etsy?</h3>
<p>In the past Etsy has restricted its marketplace to items that are handmade or unique.</p>
<p>However, they recently loosened their regulations to allow “production partners,” which includes manufactures or dropshippers that help produce your product.</p>
<p>You must disclose this information on your product listing.</p>
