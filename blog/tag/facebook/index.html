				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>As Facebook seems to make changes to its algorithms on a daily basis, it can be tough to keep up with what you can do on your Facebook page and what you can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best plan is to stick to relevant, fun content that&#8217;s not going to constantly spam people with stuff they don&#8217;t want. The easiest way to measure this is by seeing how many likes, comments, and shares you get for each post.</p>
<p>The reason we like Facebook for ecommerce advertising so much is because it&#8217;s a completely free way to test out those ads beforehand. You can send out a feeler for an ad, then see if any of your regular followers find it interesting.</p>
<p>For your well-performing posts, it&#8217;s a seamless process jumping from a regular Facebook post to a promotion. It certainly helps that Facebook has made it extremely easy for you to give them money.</p>
<p>But that poses the question: what are some of the best Facebook advertising strategies for your ecommerce store?<span id="more-13629"></span></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t simply hit the publish button and hope for the best since that&#8217;s either leaving money on the table or making you look silly because you&#8217;re not targeting the right people. You might also find that the original post design could use some tweaks before publishing it as an ad.</p>
<p>All sorts of Facebook advertising strategies are littered throughout the internet, so we&#8217;d like to cover ones that are not only unique, but they actually work.</p>
<p>Therefore, keep reading to learn more about these ecommerce Facebook advertising strategies, and make sure you follow the Golden Rule (below) before implementing any of them.</p>
<h2>The Golden Rule: Build a Sales Funnel and Email List</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you start posting Facebook ads and the response is exceptional. The sales start rolling in, your staff has plenty of work to do, and you&#8217;re in that wonderful situation where you have too many orders to fill, so it&#8217;s stressing you out.</p>
<p>Awesome! Congratulations.</p>
<p>But then a few months pass by and you&#8217;re starting to notice a dropoff in sales. You try out a few more Facebook ads, but every time you reboot the ad campaign those sales seem to trickle off a little more.</p>
<p>The problem is that you haven&#8217;t established an email list to get those customers coming back to your store. There&#8217;s also a chance that your sales funnel isn&#8217;t that great so the customer has no interest in returning.</p>
<p>In short, Facebook ads are just a starting point for your customer. If the funnel doesn&#8217;t guide them through your store with ease and prevent abandoned carts in the process, you&#8217;re going to have trouble capitalizing on the ads you pay for. It&#8217;s far easier and cheaper to keep a previous customer around than it is to seek out a new one, so there&#8217;s tons of value in having an email list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&#8217;re spending way too much money for the ads if your site doesn&#8217;t have an email list.</p>
<p>This way, you can send out reminder, receipt, promotional, and newsletter emails to hundreds or thousands of customers. Sometimes this is completely free, but most of the time it costs you a little for the email service and your time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why this is the Golden Rule. Your Facebook ads are nothing without an efficient sales funnel and email subscription form and list.</p>
<p>Now that that has been addressed, keep reading to find the best Facebook ad strategies for ecommerce advertising.</p>
<h2>5 Killer Facebook Advertising Strategies</h2>
<p>The first step to handling Facebook advertising is to understand how drastically different it is compared to Google advertising. When a person searches through Google they often have an intent to buy.</p>
<p>For instance, they&#8217;ll search for something like garden gnomes. Then, Google serves up the natural results and the sponsored ones. There&#8217;s no reason to think that the customer might find some of the ads appealing.</p>
<p>However, with Facebook, the user goes there to see what their friends are up to. They might see a cute garden gnome and click through to check it out, but the chances of them leaving are much higher.</p>
<p><em>Why is that so? </em></p>
<p>Because people don&#8217;t go to Facebook to shop. So, these strategies are built around getting folks to shop when they didn&#8217;t intend to.</p>
<h2>1. Give Customers The Excitement of the Product</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13631 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-killer-facebook-advertising-strategies-for-your-ecommerce-store.png" alt="ecommerce facebook advertising strategies" width="656" height="595" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-killer-facebook-advertising-strategies-for-your-ecommerce-store.png 656w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/try_the_world_facebook_strategy-300x272.png 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/try_the_world_facebook_strategy-650x590.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the most exciting moment of the product lifecycle? With most products, it&#8217;s typically the unboxing and revealing of what&#8217;s inside. People love the idea of receiving a product on the front stoop, then ripping it open to see the contents.</p>
<p>So why not attract more customer by showing them the best part of buying an item? This is rather common in the subscription box world, but it works for all ecommerce businesses. Take the example of Try The World; this Facebook advertising strategy utilizes beautiful images of the unboxing.</p>
<p>We see hands examining the products and showing what&#8217;s inside. It&#8217;s almost as if the customer can grasp the products and see them. This ties into consumer emotions, but it also helps that a free Paris Box is thrown in when you buy a Thailand box.</p>
<p>I absolutely love this combination, since it provides an incentive, but the photos also mimic the visual and &#8220;feeling&#8221; nature of a retail store.</p>
<h2>2. Show Contrast For Customizable Products and Items With Multiple Variants</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13632 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-killer-facebook-advertising-strategies-for-your-ecommerce-store-3.png" alt="facebook ad strategy" width="650" height="563" /></p>
<p>Studies show that high contrast ads often improve click-through rates. So what does Nike do with this information? It creates a multi-product Facebook ad with popping colors, each of which contrasts with the others.</p>
<p>In fact, you could do this with the exact same shoes, where the customer would scroll through a barrage of different colors, thus producing a stunning ad which also shows them the variants in your shop.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this ad&#8217;s effectiveness can&#8217;t only be attributed to the contrast between product colors. Notice how the background colors and bold fonts are also fighting for attention. These carousels are perfect for showcasing a wide range of your products, but it&#8217;s also important to place a link in the ad text.</p>
<p>Finally, both product variants and customizable products work well in this Facebook ad format. For instance, you might show an embroidered shirt with a red color in one picture and place that next to the same embroidered shirt with a different color and wording.</p>
<h2>3. Take Advantage of the Competition&#8217;s Fame</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13633 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-killer-facebook-advertising-strategies-for-your-ecommerce-store-4.png" alt="ecommerce advertising" width="650" height="603" /></p>
<p>If your product is truly better than a competitor, or there is some sort of feature involved that some people might enjoy better, why not talk about it in your ad?</p>
<p>There are several good things about having reputable, more famous, competitors. And that all ties into the fact that people like seeing recognizable brands. So, if you talk about that recognizable brand, then state that there&#8217;s something better about your product, you have a better chance at grabbing their attention.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at Microsoft. It&#8217;s obviously a well-known brand, but people, in general, think that MacBooks are better products. Mac sells perceived value, in that the products are often not much better, but customers think different.</p>
<p>So, Microsoft takes care of that by showing that the Surface actually has more pixels than the MacBook. Throw in some savings and you&#8217;re bound to get more customers.</p>
<h2>4. Establish a Before and After</h2>
<p>This ties into the first point we made in this article, but it puts your product into action. After someone opens the package they&#8217;re excited about using it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13634 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-killer-facebook-advertising-strategies-for-your-ecommerce-store-5.png" alt="ecommerce advertising" width="650" height="645" /></p>
<p>Blue Apron is known for displaying Facebook ads with its food box being opened, along with the &#8220;after&#8221; picture of the meal ready to eat. The great thing about this strategy is that every single product is taken out of the box and utilized in some way. And when you share before and after pictures, it helps people visualize how the product works.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you sell razors. You could have the razor coming out of the box paired with a man shaving his face and smiling. The same goes for running shoes. A shoe on a shelf sounds like a good &#8220;before&#8221; picture, but someone running through a beautiful landscape sounds great as well.</p>
<p>It also helps that Blue Apron has the promotion where the first order is free. As you can see, some of the best Facebook advertising strategies pair clever images with incentives.</p>
<h2>5. Create a Sense of Exclusivity</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13635" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-killer-facebook-advertising-strategies-for-your-ecommerce-store-6.png" alt="" width="650" height="641" /></p>
<p>The Facebook company knows all too well about how exclusivity works to its advantage. By nature, people want to belong. That&#8217;s why Dollar Shave Club talks about its &#8220;members&#8221; and its &#8220;club&#8221; quite a bit in Facebook ads.</p>
<p>This not only allows you to tell a great story about your business, but it creates a situation where your customers are wondering what they&#8217;re missing.</p>
<h2>Are You Equipped With the Best Ecommerce Facebook Advertising Strategies?</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s something that you should know- not all Facebook strategies work right off the bat. In fact, some of them don&#8217;t work at all for some online stores. The key is to make educated guesses and think about what your customers want more than anything.</p>
<p><em>Invest some time to research, gather ideas, and customize the ads based on the products you&#8217;re selling and the customers you&#8217;re targetting. What are your favourite Facebook advertising strategies? Leave a comment below</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to slap together any old Facebook post and hope that it gains tractions, but it all starts with the email list and sales funnel, then you should be inclined to utilize some of the strategies we outlined above.</p>

				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>Similar to the jewelry or bottled water businesses, furniture stores have little secrets kept hidden from you in their drawers.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what those could be?</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;re buying furniture for a few hundred dollars and selling it for several thousand.</p>
<p>It might anger you a bit as a consumer when you see markups like this, but it brings up a wonderful business opportunity.</p>
<p>Historically, furniture stores have had extremely low overhead, and the profit margins pretty much explain why you see so many fine furniture and bedding retail stores.</p>
<p>Yet, when you learn how to sell furniture online, the margins can increase even more.<span id="more-13637"></span></p>
<p>Like all online business, it&#8217;s not all that simple to start making tons of money right off the bat. However, the furniture industry is a logical one to get into since the rewards can be considerably higher than that of other industries.</p>
<p>Trust me on this one. <em>The furniture business has a lot of untapped </em>potential<em>.</em></p>
<p>Another reason we like the idea of selling furniture online is because of the necessity. Kids are constantly heading off to college in need of new or used furniture. The same can be said for when they graduate. And when they buy a new home. And when they start a family.</p>
<p>Chairs, couches, tables, desks, and every other type of furniture you can think of are required in order to lead a normal (and easier) life. Your business doesn&#8217;t have to worry about running out of buyers because <em>every single person</em> in the world is technically a buyer.</p>
<p>Because of how rewarding the furniture industry can be, I want to walk you through the methods on how to sell furniture online. We&#8217;ll talk about locating the right suppliers and wholesalers, then we&#8217;ll outline things like dropshipping, building a store, and marketing the store to customers.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Find a Reputable and Quality Furniture Wholesaler</h2>

<p>As with all products sold online, you need to first locate a reputable supplier that&#8217;s going to either sell to you at wholesale or dropship your products.</p>
<p>With furniture, it gets a little tricky since we&#8217;re talking about large pieces of merchandise. You can&#8217;t really grow a furniture business by storing all of the inventory in your apartment.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a chance you can swing that for the short-term, then opt for a warehouse or storage facility as you grow. So, those are your options when purchasing from a wholesaler. It&#8217;s not impossible to pull off, and you&#8217;re most definitely going to make good money if you can move the inventory, but you mustn&#8217;t forget about storage.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding a wholesaler, it depends on what type of furniture you would like to sell. If you&#8217;re selling vintage furniture, that&#8217;s going to involve you seeking out random items online, going to thrift shops, and scouring antique stores.</p>
<p>New items can be acquired by contacting wholesalers in your area or by going the Alibaba route.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13655 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-1.jpg" alt="ecommerce furniture business" width="650" height="454" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-1.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/search_products-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The search for furniture on Alibaba delivers thousands of results. I recommend searching based on your desired product type. That way, you have no need to sift through the endless list of suppliers who sell furniture.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13654 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-2.jpg" alt="selling furniture online" width="650" height="493" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-2.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/results-300x228.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s great about Alibaba is that when you land on a supplier you can typically buy multiple products from them. What&#8217;s even better is the fact that the website reveals things like ratings and how long the supplier has been on Alibaba.</p>
<p>As for dropshipping, this is much easier. However, you must remember that your profit margins are going to decrease because of the setup. Once you locate a product you like, contact the supplier to learn more about them. And, make sure you get the relevant contact information since it would require you to potentially speak with them over the phone as well.</p>
<p>A piece of advice which you&#8217;ve probably heard a million times:</p>
<p><strong>Always</strong> try to establish a good relationship with the suppliers because the chances are you&#8217;ll be purchasing more from them in the future.</p>
<p>Whether you select wholesale buying or dropshipping, you should always follow the same rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a point person who you&#8217;ll always be speaking with.</li>
<li>Get samples from the supplier. Since this is furniture you might have to settle for a smaller product, but most suppliers should be able to accommodate this. If not, simply buy a few products at wholesale price, then sell them to your customers.</li>
<li>Do your research. Look at reviews, product quality, and any information you can find about the company online. Many of these companies don&#8217;t have websites, so it&#8217;s a huge plus if they do.</li>
<li>Establish conditions on payment, delivery times, and how much you&#8217;re going to purchase.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;re considering dropshipping, the place to go is AliExpress. It&#8217;s similar to Alibaba except that you can get wholesale prices without buying multiple items at once. In addition, you can hook a Shopify site up to the Oberlo app to streamline the dropshipping process and automatically pull product information into your website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13649" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="373" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-3.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/aliexpress-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>After a sale is made, Oberlo sends the information to the supplier, who then packages the product and sends it to the customer.</p>
<p>You might be wondering: what if the furniture is too big to ship? Well, your research of suppliers and wholesalers on places like Alibaba and AliExpress should give you a good idea as to the types of furniture that can be shipped and that will help scale your ecommerce furniture business in the long run.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a given that there are plenty of furniture items that probably need to be picked up or shipped in a special way, but if the Alibaba suppliers are shipping a bed somehow, this means that you&#8217;ll be able to ship it as well. Or the supplier will simply dropship it for you.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Set up an Online Store Made Just For Furniture</h2>
<p>Making a furniture sales website is much easier than it used to be. Nowadays you don&#8217;t need a development degree or have much knowledge about coding at all.</p>
<p>Instead, you can utilize an ecommerce platform, which provides the hosting, design tools, marketing features, and payment gateways to start selling online today.</p>
<p>We have a solid list of the best ecommerce platforms, some of which include Shopify, Bigcommerce, and Volusion.</p>
<p>Feel free to research each one of them, but for this explanation, we&#8217;re going to walk you through building a furniture ecommerce store with Shopify.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13653" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-4.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="378" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-4.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/oberlo-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The main reason we like Shopify is because you can use the Oberlo plugin for dropshipping. Not only that, but sellers who buy wholesale can choose a theme, create products, and start selling within a matter of a few hours.</p>
<p>So, go to the Shopify theme store and start browsing themes that might work for a furniture store.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13656" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-5.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="597" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-5.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_themes-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Furniture category under the Industry tab, so that&#8217;s just about the perfect place to begin. Some of the themes are free, and some of them you have to pay for.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13651" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-6.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="447" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-6.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/furniture_themes-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>I like the Split theme after scrolling through, since I&#8217;m thinking about selling chairs and stools, and I want a modern design.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13652" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-7.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="315" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/how-to-sell-furniture-online-the-epic-guide-7.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/looker_theme-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Once you settle upon a theme that suits you, create a Shopify account. There&#8217;s a free trial so you have no need to launch a site right off the bat. Eventually, you&#8217;ll pay for the monthly service, which includes everything from hosting to design tools and marketing options to integrations.</p>
<p>In this case, I&#8217;m selecting a paid theme, but remember, there are plenty of free themes available. Just try and look around for a bit to find one that suits well.</p>
<p>After signing up for the free trial you have an impressive amount of features to play around with. I suggest building your store with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install your theme so that it looks like an actual website.</li>
<li>Add or transfer over a domain that&#8217;s going to reflect what your business is all about.</li>
<li>Create your products and potentially connect Oberlo if you plan on running a dropshipping operation.</li>
<li>Create a beautiful homepage with product galleries, your logo, Buy buttons, and whatever else you want to show.</li>
<li>Connect a payment gateway so that customers can stop by your store and make purchases.</li>
<li>Launch your store and start marketing!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 3: Learn How to Sell Furniture Online with Pro Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p>Marketing furniture is slightly different than other products.</p>
<p>Although you&#8217;ll try out marketing strategies to see what works, here are some tips for when you launch your startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first task you should complete is making an email list and placing email subscription forms on your site. This way you can send out receipts, newsletters, blog post updates, and other emails to get people coming back to your store.</li>
<li>Although furniture doesn&#8217;t perform that well on social media, it all depends on who you target. Plenty of people are into home improvement and interior design. So, think about this when making Facebook ads and Instagram posts.</li>
<li>Partner with interior designers and real estate professionals to get your products in front of customers.</li>
<li>Utilize frequent promotions and coupons to establish a customer base when getting started.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Selling Furniture Online is a Piece of Cake, Right?</h2>
<p>In this guide, we&#8217;ve covered how to find furniture suppliers, along with options for dropshipping and wholesale buying. You also know what it takes to configure an online store and start marketing your products.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s obviously much more to running an online store, but these are the basics to get everything in motion. The furniture industry is, and will always be, a gold mine. The question is whether or not you&#8217;re willing to put in the work to make your store a reality.</p>

<p class="p1">Conducting high-level research into who buys what, when and why, with regards to Americans shopping online, can be costly and time-consuming — which is why we’ve done it for you.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce has teamed up with retail and payment experts Square to dive deep into the shopping habits, behavior and preferences of thousands of American buyers across multiple generations.</p>

<h3 class="p2">Are you an omni-channel seller?</h3>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s easier than ever for businesses to have a digital presence across a variety of channels. A 2017 point-of-sale solutions survey of 1,164 U.S. business owners conducted by Square and Mercury Analytics found that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">56% have a physical store</li>
<li class="p1">21% have a pop-up store, or pop-up at events</li>
<li class="p1">34% sell through their own website (using a website building platform)</li>
<li class="p1">25% sell through Facebook (40% on social media as a whole)</li>
<li class="p1">16% sell through Amazon (more should, considering almost half of purchases begin here)</li>
<li class="p1">22% sell through other marketplaces (including Amazon, Etsy, eBay, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">However, despite how easy it is to launch a webstore, scaling an online business remains extremely difficult even for the most seasoned ecommerce expert. Ecommerce sales are growing, but many retailers are struggling to capitalize on their digital sales channels.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">The secret to success in 2017 is no longer just get it out there and see how it performs. The most successful retailers are strategic and targeted in their efforts, both offline and on.</p>

<p class="p1">It’s called omni-channel selling, and it’s something BigCommerce and Square have been exploring over the past year, in an attempt to help connect the dots between your business and the those who want to buy from your business.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">It’s not just about broadcasting on all channels, though. Effectively targeting a ready-to-buy audience requires solid data and statistics on your customers.</p>

				<div class="post-content">
				
<p>Building an ecommerce store is easy.</p>
<p>Getting people to buy is hard.</p>
<p><em>Or is it?</em></p>
<p><em>The fact is:</em></p>
<p>It all boils down to your customers.</p>
<p>This is how most marketers and business owners play it out:</p>
<p>They &#8216;think&#8217; that people would be interested in cat socks. No problem.</p>
<p>Then they <em>imagine</em> that girls in the age range of 8-16 would be interested in buying cat socks.</p>
<p>They build out an entire business targeting girls with an age range of 8-16. They then wonder why they&#8217;re not making sales.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue here is that the thought process is flawed.</p>
<p><em>Everything you see and hear </em>is<em> perspective.</em></p>
<p>Such perspectives may not be correct all the time. And building business based on perspectives is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Business and marketing business should be data-backed. You need real data showing you where and what your target audience is.</p>
<p>And in this post, I&#8217;m going to show you how to get that data- step by step.</p>
<p><span id="more-13581"></span></p>
<h2>The 3 Steps to Nailing Target Market Demographics</h2>
<p>Demographics are simply the statistical characteristics of a sample set of people. If you&#8217;re able to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>where your ideal customers hang out online</li>
<li>what they read</li>
<li>how they compare products, and</li>
<li>where they buy from</li>
</ul>
<p>you have an unfair advantage compared to your competitors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll cover the process of finding the ideal target market demographic for your ecommerce store in 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Start with the keywords</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, I might be a biased here, but think about it:</p>
<p>All search activity starts with a <strong>keyword.</strong></p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re trying to identify the target market demographic that&#8217;ll result in sales for your keyword, it&#8217;s only sensible that you start your research with keywords.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the bitcoin and cryptocurrency niche for example.</p>
<p>First, you need to so some KW research:</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use the free Google Keyword Planner:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13584" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="364" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/google-kwyord-planner-to-find-target-keywords-300x170.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/google-kwyord-planner-to-find-target-keywords-768x436.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/google-kwyord-planner-to-find-target-keywords-650x369.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just search for keyword ideas related to &#8216;bitcoin price&#8217; for now:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13587 size-large" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="860" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-1.jpg 762w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search-223x300.jpg 223w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search-768x1032.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search-650x873.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keywords-search.jpg 902w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This should pull some solid keyword ideas around the base keyword, that we can use for further research. And since we&#8217;re trying to uncover communities where our target customers hang out, let&#8217;s look for keywords that people might discuss in such communities:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13588" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-2.jpg" alt="bitcoin price keyword ideas GKP" width="640" height="792" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-2.jpg 827w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP-242x300.jpg 242w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP-768x951.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP-650x805.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-keyword-ideas-GKP.jpg 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s time to find out where your target customers hang out, which is Step 2.</p>
<h3><strong>Forums</strong></h3>
<p>First, let&#8217;s do a google search for online communities around cat socks.</p>
<p>Simply run a google search with any of the following Google search operators:</p>
<p>keyword &#8220;forum&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by Fireboard&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by ip.board&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by phpbb&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by phpbb3&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by SMF&#8221;<br />
keyword &#8220;powered by vbulletin&#8221;<br />
keyword forum<br />
keyword intitle:forum<br />
keyword inurl:forum</p>
<p>When I do a search for bitcoin price &#8220;forum&#8221;, it pulls up a number of forums with raging discussions on bitcoin price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, make sure you install the SEO quake chrome extension, which has a great SERP overlay feature that shows you how much Semrush traffic each forum gets directly from the SERPs:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13589" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-3.jpg" alt="bitcoin price forums search" width="640" height="507" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-3.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-forums-search-300x238.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-forums-search-768x608.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-price-forums-search-650x515.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I prefer to choose forums that get at least 50K searches for competitive niches like bitcoin, and at least 20k for moderate yet awesome niches like cat socks &#x1f642;</p>
<p>Now, go ahead and signup to 4 of the best forums you can find from the SERPs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Bonus Tip: </strong>Since I like to do this once in a while to identify new interests and market demographics, I create a separate Google chrome user and signup to forums in that niche using that user account. This way, I just have to open that chrome user window anytime I want to do research.</em></p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve created accounts on 4 of the best forums you can find this way, login to the none by one and spend some time in each of them.</p>
<p>And these are our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>look for relevant threads and find the pain points for people in the niche that we can try to solve</li>
<li>find the characteristics of people sharing their problems in the forums</li>
<li>note anything else that can help us</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I just logged into Bitcointalk.org, one of the prominent forums in the bitcoin niche, and found this relevant thread:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13590 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-4.jpg" alt="bitcoin thread" width="2760" height="1054" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-4.jpg 2760w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-300x115.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-768x293.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-1024x391.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-thread-650x248.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 2760px) 100vw, 2760px" /></p>
<p>There are several insights in the first page alone (there are 28 pages full of comments):</p>
<ol>
<li>Users frequent preev.com and epsilon.one to check prices.</li>
<li>Some users use alert services to keep track of prices</li>
<li>Some users hold multiple cryptocurrencies and check the prices of those too.</li>
<li>The users who check for bitcoin prices the most are traders who do short-term or scalp trading.</li>
<li>Some users are crazy about checking BTC prices all the time</li>
</ol>
<p>Whoa! Those were new insights even for me. To be frank, I check BTC prices daily too, and I&#8217;ve never even heard of preev.com and epsilon.one.</p>
<p>Although we can take a look at the forum profiles of the members who posted these comments, I generally don&#8217;t trust forum profile data. For uncovering demographic and user data, let&#8217;s take a look at relevant Facebook groups.</p>
<h3><strong>Facebook Groups</strong></h3>
<p>Login to Facebook, and search for Bitcoin price forums.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13591" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-5.jpg" alt="bitcoin_price fb groups" width="640" height="694" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-5.jpg 945w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups-277x300.jpg 277w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups-768x832.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups-650x704.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin_price-fb-groups.jpg 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Join the top 3 and look around just like you did on forums.</p>
<p>Now, onto the final step:</p>
<p><strong>The grunt work begins:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this step is not to identify topics or pain points of BTC enthusiasts. It&#8217;s to identify the characteristics of users who are interested in constant price checking.</p>
<p>First, start looking at posts from at least a month back in these groups and list down (or open in new tabs) profiles of actual users who talk about bitcoin prices. Don&#8217;t check profiles of the folks sharing price update links (these are marketers like you and me :))</p>
<p>Next, there are two plays you can use:</p>
<p>Open each profile and look for commonalities in characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is he/she a millennial?</li>
<li>Are they working?</li>
<li>What profile/field do they work in?</li>
<li>Are they active on Facebook (check their timelines)?</li>
<li>Have they listed any other websites/social profiles in their about section?</li>
<li>Any websites/blogs they share regularly (this one is gold)</li>
</ul>
<p>I typically just create a Google sheet and list the profile links of at least 50 users who look like my target customer/user.</p>
<p>I then create columns for each of the above data points and fill them one by one.</p>
<p>Well, actually &#8211; I just list the profile links and get my VA to fill them out &#x1f642;</p>
<p>And to be brutally frank, I just scrape the user list from groups and copy/paste them into a Google sheet, but that strategy is for another day &#x1f642;</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done, you should have a hardcore DB of target users and some solid data on them.</p>
<p>These are the data points that I pay most attention to for ecommerce stores:</p>
<ol>
<li>Job profiles (are they working and where?)</li>
<li>Age ranges</li>
<li>Facebook activity</li>
<li>Blogs/websites they share regularly</li>
</ol>
<p>50 is just a target for you to get started. There is nothing wrong with having a considerably larger list.</p>
<p>The more data we have, the more accurate the commonalities we find will be.</p>
<p>Just take a look at the data you&#8217;ve collected from user profiles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the data I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most users are from the US and Russia.</li>
<li>Most are millennials and in the age range of 25-36</li>
<li>Most of them are not active on Facebook (duh)</li>
<li>They share price update posts about sudden crypto price spikes</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you get where we&#8217;re getting to? All the above points are demographics &#x1f600;</p>
<p>You can target users on almost any paid platform using all this data, and we now also know the interests of people interested in the &#8216;bitcoin price&#8217; niche.</p>
<p>Wondering how all that insight will help us craft a content strategy for our store (or blog in this example)?</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how:</strong></p>
<p>-they like to read price updates multiple times a day- which means you should try to push out atleast 2 posts on price updates every day</p>
<p>-Our target market demographic includes millennials, so use millenial-targeted copy for your ads and CTAs.</p>
<p>-Publish guest posts on websites frequented by target audience</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Want to take it a step further?</strong></h3>
<p>What if I told you that you can outreach to your target users and invite them to surveys so that you can gather data at scale?</p>
<p>And this is how you can do it:</p>
<p>After you create a list (or scrape) of users fitting your ideal customer/user persona, send them a message on Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>Do not invite them to an interview or survey straight away.</p>
<p>Start with a personalized question like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hey {{Name}},</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Noticed that you&#8217;re active in the group. Thought I&#8217;d reach out and connect. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What websites do you use to keep track of the price?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p>If they reply, respond with this message:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks a ton {{Name}}!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m actually thinking about starting a BTC blog- I spend most of my time reading about it anyway.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>However, I&#8217;ve no idea about what our community may be looking for online, so I put together a short </em>2-minute questionnaire<em> to find out.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Do you mind spending 2 minutes to fill it out: <strong>Questionnaire link.</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you&#8217;re too busy, I understand &#x1f642;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks again,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>{{Your name}}</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wondering how to set up the questionnaire? You should be easily able to set one up for free using TypeForm.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13592" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.png" alt="typeform questionnaire example" width="640" height="411" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store.png 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/typeform-example-300x193.png 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/typeform-example-768x493.png 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/typeform-example-650x417.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>And I&#8217;m lazier than you, so I also set up a Zapier integration so that every single time someone fills out and submits a questionnaire, it gets added to a Google sheet as a new row.</p>
<p>Nifty, huh?</p>
<h2><strong>Going all in- In-Depth Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>Warning: this strategy may not be well suited for well-known niches.</p>
<p>But for cases where target users may not be very active online, or where you need more granular and in-depth demographic data, it&#8217;s actually a good idea to physically interact with actual customers!</p>
<p>The folks over at Food On the Table (now Genius Kitchen) created the first version of their website after they followed an actaul mom around for three staggering weeks to understand her shopping and buying habits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13593" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-6.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="393" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/how-to-find-the-ideal-target-market-demographic-for-your-store-6.jpg 1024w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Genius-Kitchen-300x184.jpg 300w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Genius-Kitchen-768x471.jpg 768w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Genius-Kitchen-650x399.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Food on the Table now has over a million users. That&#8217;s the grunt work paying off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I sign off, there are 3 key points to remember:</p>
<p>-this is the step in researching and finding your target market. Set aside some time for it.</p>
<p>-forums are a goldmine (or bitcoin mine lol) of data about your target market demographic andaudience. Don&#8217;t avoid them because you hate creating accounts</p>
<p>-grunt work really pays off &#x1f642;</p>

<p class="p1">Wrong pricing, fake reviews or just bad customer service can kill your Amazon adventure faster than you think.</p>
<p class="p1">To many, this makes Amazon complicated, but&#8230;</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Your pricing strategy on Amazon must be dead simple, and lead with the customer in mind.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Your goal is to generate as many sales as possible, get authentic product reviews and provide the best customer service to your Amazon customers.</p>
<p class="p1">In this chapter, I will detail the exact strategies we used to build our private label brand KAVAJ from scratch in 2011.</p>
<p class="p1">Further, I’ll give you insight into our approach to pricing on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">We are selling our products solely as a marketplace seller via Amazon (Europe, USA, Japan) and have sold more than 500,000 KAVAJ products, <strong>making more than $19 million in revenue</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we begin, always remember your ultimate goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">You want your products to be within the top three spots on the first page of the search results for your most relevant keywords.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="p3">3 Steps to Selling Successfully on Amazon</h2>
<h3 class="p4">1. Optimize your product detail page.</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>The basics just aren’t very good.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Before you even start thinking about generating traffic, putting any marketing budget to work, or refining your Amazon pricing strategy, you have to do the basics.</p>
<p class="p1">On Amazon, this means you have to optimize your Amazon product detail page for Amazon’s organic search results.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">The vast majority of sales on Amazon happen through search and more than 70% of it on page one of Amazon search results.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">So, it’s best to spend time optimizing your products for Amazon’s search.  </p>
<p class="p1">Bryan Bowman details every aspect on this topic in his part “A Seller’s Guide to Amazon SEO.” Make sure to read that first.</p>
<h3 class="p3">2. Set your prices for Page One on Amazon.</h3>
<p class="p1">If you get your pricing wrong, you will either lose money or won’t sell anything.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Setting the right price on Amazon doesn’t have to be that hard for private label products where you don’t have any competition on your Amazon product page.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">In general, there are two variables you need to consider for every single product you sell on Amazon.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">You want to be profitable (Find your lowest price)</li>
<li class="p1">You want to maximize profits (Find your highest price possible)</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">First, you need to consider all of your costs, and what your prices would be for you to be profitable on Amazon with those costs included.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>You need to calculate your floor price.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Second, your price must be competitive related to your most important search terms to get your product on page one of Amazon search results.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">More than 70% of sales on Amazon happen on page one of organic search.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1"><em>No one will find and order your overpriced product on page 23.</em></p>
<h4 class="p4">How to Calculate Your Amazon Floor Price:</h4>
<p class="p1">To operate in the green, you need to know all your costs, take all of them into account, and then determine your price floor.</p>
<p class="p1">You can find below the list of costs which you have to take into your equation.</p>
<h5 class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Product Acquisition Cost</span></h5>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Shipping</li>
<li class="p1">Customs</li>
<li class="p1">Payment wiring</li>
<li class="p1">Amazon Commission</li>
<li class="p1">Amazon FBA Fees</li>
<li class="p1">Customer Return Fees
<ul>
<li class="p1">On all returns, Amazon keeps 20% of the original commission as a return fee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1">Your own returns-related fees (return shipping, disposal and product write-offs fees)</li>
<li class="p1">Variable overhead allocation costs</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are also category-specific costs which you need to consider. For example, if you sell clothing, Amazon will charge you FBA fees related to customer return shipping costs.</p>
<h4 class="p4">How to Find Your Upper Price Floor:</h4>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Forget about overpricing your product! Amazon will tell you your upper price floor.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Always remember, your ultimate goal is to have your products ranked on page one of Amazon search results. This is where the magic happens, and you can really sell volume.</p>
<p class="p1">However, it is one thing to get your products to page one with deep marketing pockets (e.g. deep launch discounts, giveaways or a big Amazon Sponsored Products budget), but <strong>you want your product to stay on page one and generate sustainable, profitable organic sales.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">To get your products to stick on page one, you must consider the competition around you.</p>
<p class="p1">This is easy to evaluate. Just search your top three keywords for your product and review the pricing of the search results on page one.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Now, answer this question:</strong> are your prices within a reasonable range of the prices you find there?</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">From our experience, you can be 20% more expensive than the highest price on page one of search results.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">For example, the highest price you can find on page one is $40. Your upper price floor thus should be $48.</p>
<p class="p1">If your price is higher, you will most likely never make it to the top of Amazon search results.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Keep your prices stable, with exceptions.</h3>
<p class="p1">To build customer trust and a sustainable long-term brand on Amazon, keep your prices stable.</p>
<p class="p1">There are, of course, exceptions.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">The number one reason for price deviations is to increase your sales rank, which results in more organic sales later.</li>
<li class="p1">The second reason for price cuts is cross-selling your products, which in the end also results in better sales rank for all products included in the cross-selling promotion.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Usually, this means cutting your prices close to break-even or below profitability. This is most often done during new product launches.</p>
<p class="p1">My company deviates from our standard prices mainly in the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>New Product Launches</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We offer 15% launch discount for all customers</li>
<li class="p1">We offer up to 50% price cuts for repeat customers on our email list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cross Selling</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We offer up to 40% discount for bundles sales. e.g. If a customer buys an iPad case, he will get a 40% discount for an Apple pencil case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Black Friday or Other Holidays</strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Stock Clearance</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">In case you have overstock, this can help get rid of your overstock. It can also revive a dead product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Finally, before you even think about cutting prices below profitability, always keep in mind that you will only have fun (i.e. be successful) selling on Amazon once you can generate organic sales with a decent profit margin.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How to Drive Traffic to your Amazon Products</h2>
<p class="p1">Without traffic, there are no sales. Just listing your product on Amazon and hoping for traffic and sales is not enough to be successful.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, you need not only the organic traffic on Amazon, but you need to drive traffic from external sources to your Amazon product page.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Paris, here we come… (A Case Study)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Not long after leaving Amazon to start my own company, my team and I had a brilliant marketing idea. We were so convinced that it would work that we boarded a plane from Germany to France.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we left, we printed off thousands of flyers and planned on handing them out in front of the Apple store in Paris. We knew that tons of people would be standing in front of the store waiting to get their new device, and we knew that we would have a captive audience.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>We gave away every single flyer that we brought.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">People genuinely seemed interested in our product. They liked the design; they liked meeting us as the creators, and we had several promising conversations that we believed would turn into sales.</p>
<p class="p1">When we got home to Germany, we were eager to check our dashboard for sales. We logged in and were totally shocked. We had sold just one case.</p>
<p class="p1">JUST ONE.</p>
<p class="p1">We immediately knew we had to change our strategy to drive traffic to our products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Here are our the three key strategies we are using today to drive most of our traffic to our Amazon product pages.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Build an email list.</h3>
<p class="p1">An email list is a great way to boost your sales at product launch.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We use our list to send our customers directly to our new product pages on Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">We also give them a discount code for the purchase of the products and often see a good jump-start on sales from that.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">As a seller on Amazon, you might be wondering how you can build a list since you don&#8217;t get the real email addresses from customers and also are not allowed to write them for marketing reasons.</p>
<p class="p1">Begin with these three, easy-to-implement ways to start building your own list:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Add a sign-up field on your website</strong>, like a newsletter sign-up, an ebook download, or the like.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Communicate your newsletter sign-up option</strong> on your social media channels and on your packaging.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>After your sale at Amazon, you can send one email to your customer</strong>. Point them to your newsletter sign-up page in this email.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Our current tool of choice is ConvertKit, which has a very easy-to-use interface and allows us to easily tag our customers and build individual newsletter campaigns.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Place targeted Facebook ads.</h3>
<p class="p1">In 2014 we shifted a big part of our external ads budget from Google to Facebook.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Today,  Facebook Ads are our most important external paid traffic source.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">On Facebook, you have multiple advertising options, and you don&#8217;t need an existing fan base for that.</p>
<p class="p1">The great thing about Facebook Ads is that you can define your target audience and create a post which will show up directly in a user&#8217;s Facebook feed.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, for our new iPhone 6 cases, we created a target audience for women between 30 and 35 with kids younger than 3 years AND an interest in photography.</p>
<p class="p1">We generated awesome results from these ads.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>We only had one issue with our Facebook Ads: </strong>we could not tell if the ads were profitable.</p>
<p class="p1">We spent one-and-a-half years developing analytics with quantified markets.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, it is impossible for us to imagine doing business without analytics –– and now you have the opportunity to use it as well!</p>
<p class="p1">Working with this Amazon conversion tracking tool catapulted our Facebook marketing performance into entirely new dimensions. The bottom line is that with analytics, you finally know whether:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your Facebook advertising is worthwhile</li>
<li class="p1">You are really addressing the target groups that buy your products on Amazon</li>
<li class="p1">Your advertising is actually generating revenue </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p3">3. Use Amazon Sponsored Product placements.</h3>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Amazon Sponsored Products is by far the fastest way to get your product on the first page of Amazon search results.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Amazon Sponsored Products work similar to Google AdWords, where you bid on search terms.</p>
<p class="p1">If a person is searching on Amazon for your product, you can buy an ad relative to those search terms, and your offer will appear next to the best results.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The great thing about Amazon Sponsored Products is that it is very easy to set up. You can do it in a matter of minutes.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We did realize pretty early in the process, though, that even in a simple interface, you have to manage your account carefully and regularly to avoid an exploding marketing budget.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>There are two main reasons for this.</em></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">First, <strong>Amazon is continually improving the algorithm</strong>, meaning your successful campaign today will lose money tomorrow.</li>
<li class="p1">Second, <strong>the competition on your ads is getting tougher</strong> as more sellers enter the marketplace. Amazon has also opened the sponsored products program to Amazon Retail clients.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">I recommend either having someone in-house watching your campaigns very closely or working with MarketPlaceClicks, who is managing our account for us.</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Point all product links to Amazon.</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>You might ask: </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Why should I send my customers over to Amazon if I already have my own website?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The number one reason is that your ultimate goal is to be on the first page of the search results and, if possible, in the top three listing. This is where the big money is made, not by a single sale on your site.</p>
<p class="p1">Apart from our website, we point every link on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, our blog posts and our email newsletter to one specific Amazon product page.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<p class="h3">Expert Tip</p>
</p>
<p class="p1">You can build high search engine ranking for your own online store through content marketing and influencer outreach work to gain backlinks from relevant, high-quality sites.</p>
<p class="p1"></div>
</p>
<h3 class="p1">5. Get your products in the hands of bloggers and Youtubers.  </h3>
<p class="p1">Youtube is the second biggest search engine in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s really good to have a ton of reviews about your products on there so that you show up first in search no matter where they search for you.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Remember, Google owns Youtube.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Choose the Youtubers and bloggers who fit best with your product and brand, and offer them free review samples.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are few tips for outreach:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Be sure to word your outreach genuinely, and help solve a problem for their audience.</li>
<li class="p1">Know that they receive tons of these emails regularly.</li>
<li class="p1">Keep a running list of who you are reaching out to and who responds.</li>
<li class="p1">Use this to build yourself an influencer list.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you give your products away for review, only give them your top-selling product.</p>
<p class="p1">Put all your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, you want to have this product in the top three of the first page of search results, so you have to ensure that all the traffic is going to that one product.</p>
<h3 class="p1">6. Maximize your product packaging.  </h3>
<p class="p1">Every case we ship includes a small booklet and two business-card-sized inserts with 10% discount codes for customers to give their friends or use on their next Amazon order of a KAVAJ product.</p>
<p class="p1">Customers are telling their friends about us and they’re buying more cases for themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">We also use our best customer testimonials to build trust.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">We put our best quote on the outside packaging and, for our most important products, we include a customer case study inside a small booklet.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="p1">7. Create effective Google Ad campaigns.</h3>
<p class="p1">We spent a lot of money on Google in our early days. However, Facebook Ads and Amazon Sponsored Products totally changed the game.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, you should use Google AdWords as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Focus on brand name:</strong> Focus your efforts on your brand name and the most specific keywords in the long tail. We get most of the traffic from Google from people searching for our brand “KAVAJ.”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Focus on long-tail keywords:</strong> In the long tail, we only create very specific campaigns for our products, which must include the device name, the material, and the color. For example, those words that are keywords to our product, phrases like &#8220;iPad Air 2 case leather black.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">How to Get Real Product Reviews</h2>
<p class="p1">Without product reviews, you won’t sell anything on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">The amount and the quality of reviews are the most important aspects of your reviews to increase your conversion rate.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, only 1 out of 100 customers writes a review.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Here are a few ways to increase your number of authentic product reviews.</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="post-detail__recommended">
<p class="h3">WARNING</p>
</p>
<p class="p1">Before getting into the details, this subject requires a quick warning, as Amazon is currently cracking down on sellers buying fake reviews.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Never mess with Amazon.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Avoid review clubs and excessive giveaways, which do not comply with Amazon’s Terms of Services (ToS).</li>
<li class="p1">Don’t give away a free product in exchange for an Amazon review.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Your goal should be to build trust with your customers and a long-term brand on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">Even if the customer is leaving a disclaimer that he got the product for free, it will hurt your product and there is a high chance that Amazon will either delete all those reviews or even suspend your seller account.</p>
<p class="p1">This is what you should do instead.</p>
<p class="p1"></div>
</p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Email your customers after purchase and ask for reviews.</h3>
<p class="p1">You can use tools like Feedback Genius to automate this process.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Send the email a few days after the purchase.</li>
<li class="p1">Ask in a neutral way and don’t force them to leave a positive review.</li>
<li class="p1">Provide a direct link to the review page, as a lot of your customers have probably never written a review before.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">You can also use this opportunity to make sure the product was delivered correctly and give the customer a chance to tell you about their experience (good or bad) so you can make the most of the interaction and build lifetime brand loyalty.</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Use &#8220;wrong&#8221; positive seller feedback to get product reviews.</h3>
<p class="p1">People often confuse seller feedback with product reviews.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, the often really good product feedback is not very visible for other customers.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-17482 aligncenter" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-secret-amazon-pricing-strategy-to-crush-the-competition-25.jpg" alt="selling-on-amazon-29" width="750" height="522" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-29.jpg 1085w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-29-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-29-750x522.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Review your seller feedback regularly for people who actually provide positive product feedback and ask them via email to also write a product review.</p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Comment on reviews.</h3>
<p class="p1">Everything on the Amazon product page is public.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">In particular, the reviews and comments sections will be read by almost all future customers. This is your chance to stand out.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Be sure to comment on any negative product reviews or on reviews where a customer has a question. This is your opportunity to build trust and increase your conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">Further, many customers who initially gave your product a negative review might even change it for a positive one because they are grateful that you cared about their issue.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17483" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-secret-amazon-pricing-strategy-to-crush-the-competition-26.jpg" alt="selling-on-amazon-30" width="750" height="494" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-30.jpg 1157w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-30-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-30-750x494.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Ask customers who email you for feedback.</h3>
<p class="p1">The easiest way to get product reviews on Amazon is by simply asking customers who tell you how much they love your product.</p>
<p class="p1">Whenever you receive an email, a customer service call or positive feedback on your social media channels, just ask them politely if they are willing to share their experience with other customers on Amazon.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How to Provide Outstanding Customer Service</h2>
<div class="post-detail__quote">
<p class="p1">You can&#8217;t do anything wrong if your Amazon customer benefits. Amazon itself is the most customer-centric company in the world. They expect the same standard from you as a seller.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div>
</div>
<p class="p1">Your best marketing tool on Amazon today will be outstanding customer service.</p>
<p class="p1">Your goal should be to create a “wow” experience which will help spread word of mouth.</p>
<p class="p1">To explain, what I mean by “wow” experience, I want to share a success email we received:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17484" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-secret-amazon-pricing-strategy-to-crush-the-competition-27.jpg" alt="selling-on-amazon-31" width="750" height="457" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-31.jpg 1270w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-31-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-31-750x457.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">We not only exceeded his expectation but we &#8220;surpassed anything that I could have expected!&#8221; In the end, he helped us fix the issue by sending us images and he will recommend our iPad Pro cases to his management team.</p>
<p class="p1">This how you turn a negative into a positive.</p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Start your customer service on your Amazon product page.</h3>
<p class="p1">This is the place where all your customers start their customer journey, read reviews, ask questions, check out your seller feedback and finally click the &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221; button.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend implementing a daily routine for your product pages including the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Comment on negative product reviews and offer instant help</li>
<li class="p1">Answer questions in the Q&amp;A section</li>
<li class="p1">Manage your seller feedback actively</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">2. Answer your customers fast and be generous.</h3>
<p class="p1">The 2nd pillar of your customer service is email. You must answer all emails within 24 hours or faster and strive to resolve every customer service issue in a single communication.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend to apply the following four principles:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Answer all emails within 24 hours</li>
<li class="p1">Provide a solution in your first reply</li>
<li class="p1">Make it simple for your customer</li>
<li class="p1">Be generous</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">3. Be responsive on your social media channels.</h3>
<p class="p1">Your customers will talk about or to you and they expect you to engage with them on their favorite social media channel.</p>
<p class="p1">We recommend using Facebook and Twitter as your first customer service channels. You can exceed expectations here and “wow” your customers if you reply to all questions within an hour.</p>
<p class="p1">We also recommend creating a FAQ section on your website that answers common questions. Finally, offer an easy-to-use contact form on your website.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How to Go International on Amazon</h2>
