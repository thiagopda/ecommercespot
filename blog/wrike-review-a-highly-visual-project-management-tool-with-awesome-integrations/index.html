				<div class="post-content single-post-view">
				
<p>When it comes to finding a project management software for your online store, it&#8217;s not easy to choose one that&#8217;s highly customizable, affordable, and so visually brilliant.</p>
<p>I often get confused when a software boasts many functions but find it quite hard to use.</p>
<p>However, Wrike has taken a different approach.<span id="more-13582"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fully customizable project management suite with tools for time tracking, project planning, and communication. It stands out from the rest due to its highly-visual interface and the attractive price tag.</p>
<p>With this review of Wrike, I&#8217;ll explain to you why it&#8217;s a bang for your buck.</p>
<h2>What Project Management Tools Are Included with Wrike?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time tracking</li>
<li>Project Planning</li>
<li>Project Organization</li>
<li>An interactive timeline</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Online collaboration tools</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these tools are meant for teams of all sizes. There are companies like Airbnb, HootSuite, and TGI Fridays managing parts of their operations with Wrike.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wrike&#8217;s interface is intuitive and clean so that small businesses and new users can jump right in. Not only that, but there&#8217;s a free pricing plan along with a professional plan for only $9.80 per user per month.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s quite affordable for a small business.</p>
<h2>The Best Bunch of Features from Wrike</h2>
<p>Although the features vary from plan to plan, it&#8217;s worth looking into the standout tools that could potentially turn your online or physical store into a more efficient enterprise.</p>
<h3>A Large Collection of Integrations</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-13610 size-full" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations.jpg" alt="wrike review" width="650" height="568" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wrike_review_-_extensions-300x262.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>One of the most valuable aspects of any project management tool is how many apps can integrate with it. Wrike has a giant library of third-party software and apps that integrate. You can take a look at the full list here, but here are some of the highlights:</p>

<h3>Project Management with Timelines and Resource Management</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13607" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="338" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-1.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/chart-300x156.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Along with live editing, file management, and request forms, the project management module delivers Gantt-chart timelines for you to visualize your entire project schedule. There&#8217;s also a beautiful resource management area for adjusting where your most valuable assets need to go.</p>
<h3>Collaboration With Live Streams and Great Communication Tools</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13608" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="371" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-2.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/communications-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Wrike has quick real-time communication tools like live chats, tagging, and an option to chat with people outside of your company. The personal dashboard is where most of the action takes place. You can work on proofing and approvals, and check the live stream to see exactly what everyone is working on.</p>
<h3>Customization for Fields, Workflows, and User Groups</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13609" src="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-3.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="369" srcset="http://ecommercespot.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wrike-review-a-highly-visual-project-management-tool-with-awesome-integrations-3.jpg 650w, https://d3j91itysyqfr3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/workflow-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Customization comes into play for a project management software since you&#8217;re trying to give your team more flexibility and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wrike has options for inserting whatever custom fields you want. You can also create your own user groups, project dashboards, and workflows. In short, it&#8217;s all about matching how your team works.</p>
<h2>Who Should Consider Wrike For Project Management?</h2>
<p>Wrike has clients from all over the world, so it has developed plans and features for several types of organizations, large and small.</p>
<p>For instance, marketers have been known to enjoy Wrike for its ability to coordinate across teams and manage events. The resource and workload management is an upside for marketers, and so is the time tracking.</p>
<p>We also like it for marketing agencies, product development, project managers, and team leaders.</p>
<p>For example, some product development professionals utilize Wrike as a way to create, prioritize, and assign requirements to track the development in real-time. This allows you to manage your resources wisely, centralize your product vision, and accelerate delivery.</p>
<p>Feel free to read about the many real-life success stories from companies using Wrike.</p>
<h2>Wrike Review: The Pricing</h2>
<p>As we mentioned a little earlier in this Wrike review, the platform starts with a Free plan, which works great for sharing tasks within small teams.</p>
<p>In addition to that, each plan above that has a free trial for you and your company to try it out before committing to any payments.</p>
<p>This pricing setup appears transparent and inexpensive. It&#8217;s also nice that you have some flexibility just in case you need to upgrade or downgrade depending on your company growth.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the pricing plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> &#8211; For $0 per month, you receive tools for task management, file sharing, real-time activity stream, a spreadsheet view, basic integrations, iPhone and Android apps, cloud storage, and 2GB of space.</li>
<li><strong>Professional</strong> &#8211; $9.80 per user per month supports 5-15 users, all features from the previous plan, task and subtask management, a dynamic timeline, advanced integrations, shareable dashboards, unlimited collaborators, from 5GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong> &#8211; $24.80 per user per month supports 5-15 users, all features from the previous plan, custom fields and workflows, shared real-time reports, report templates, graphical analytics, resource management, request forms, time tracking, user groups and permissions, Salesforce integration, a branded workspace, from 50GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
<li><strong>Marketers</strong> &#8211; $34.60 per user per month supports 5-200 users, all features from the previous plan, video proofing, an Adobe Creative Cloud extension, a tailored workspace, from 5GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise</strong> &#8211; This plan requires you to contact Wrike for pricing, but it has support for up to unlimited users, all features from the previous plans, Active Directory integration, SAML 2.0 single sign-on, two-factor authentication, password policies, IT-controlled admin permissions, user audit reports, network access and compliance policies, from 100GB of storage space, and from 15GB of video uploads per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with a Chrome extension and its availability in 10 languages like English, Spanish, Italian, and German, the pricing is rather impressive.</p>
<h2>Is Wrike Right For You?</h2>
<p>One of the last elements I like to examine involves customer service. To start, Wrike runs a wonderful blog, releasing tips, stories, and news to guide you in the world of collaboration, leadership, and productivity.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of resources and free eBooks for marketers, project managers, and other collaborators.</p>
<p>Wrike also includes a solid help center for all customers, along with community forums, webinars, consultation services, and a translation portal.</p>
<p>Wrike is one of the most impressive project management tools available on the market and makes sense for online stores and regular businesses, big and small.</p>
<p><em>Okay, I promise this will be the last time- the pricing is sweet!</em></p>
